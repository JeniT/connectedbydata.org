We worked with [Create Gloucestershire](https://www.creategloucestershire.co.uk/), [Active Gloucestershire](https://www.activegloucestershire.org/) and [Barnwood Trust](https://www.barnwoodtrust.org/) to organise a [one-day county-based conference](https://dataday.org.uk) exploring how data can work better for local communities.

The event, on 26th April 2023, aims to support practice, creative and critical conversations around data: using a mix of programmed content and open space facilitation to explore collective challenges and opportunities. 

We'll be reflecting on replicable aspects of the event design, and how these might support other place-based data conversations.
