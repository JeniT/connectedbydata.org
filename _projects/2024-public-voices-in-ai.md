**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** have been commissioned by [Public Voices in AI](https://digitalgood.net/dg-research/public-voices-in-ai/) to facilitate a Citizens Advisory Group supporting their year long project.

<!--more-->
The Responsible AI UK programme on Public Voices in AI, coordinated by the Digital Good Network, is a year long programme (April 2024 - March 2025) working to “ensure that public voices are front and centre in artificial intelligence research, development and policy.”.
The project involves a number of tracks, including:
* Evidence review;
* Survey research;
* Resource production;
* Synthesis products

The project team want to create a citizens advisory group who will meet over the project duration to provide advice on programme design and activities; and 
input into other project activities, such as acting as a focus group to provide feedback on the development of resources to support effective public participation around AI.
