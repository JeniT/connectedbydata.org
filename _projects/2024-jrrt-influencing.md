AI and data are everywhere in our political discourse and our everyday lives. Shaped properly, the benefits brought by such new technologies could lead to public benefit, with better services and better policies allowing us all to live better lives. But power over AI and data is currently concentrated in a small number of large companies working in their own interests, apparently untouched by questions of democratic accountability, and politicians easily seduced by hype or slowed by panic.

With governments increasingly using data and AI to make life changing decisions and big tech setting the rules and parameters of our digital lives, it is critical to bring democracy to the debate: we need greater transparency and openness about how these decisions are made, rights and other protections to ensure they are not harmful, and participation and deliberation to make them work in the democratic public interest. Government needs to demonstrate trustworthiness in its use of such technologies â€“ not doing so risks disenfranchisement and alienation from and a further loss of trust in the political system. Who gets to decide our AI future is a question of critical democratic importance. 

We seek to see:
* Progressive political parties heading into the next election with progressive policies on AI and data in their manifestos and post-election plans
* The Data Protection and Digital Information (No 2) Bill is either heavily amended or blocked
* A strong and diverse network of civil society organisations and research and academic institutions supports and scrutinises progressive policymakers on AI and data

We are particularly grateful to the [Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust](https://www.jrrt.org.uk/) for their generous help and support for this work. Our previous JRRT funded project '[Our Data Futures](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2022-dpdib)' has now ended.
