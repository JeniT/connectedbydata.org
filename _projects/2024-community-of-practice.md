As part of our project on[ ‘Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects’](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), we’re interested in supporting practitioners – particularly in the public sector – who are engaging the public on data and AI. To that end, we’re setting up a community of practice. This is funded until the end of March, which gives us the chance to set an agenda for a pilot period and see how well it works.

We’re keen that it complements and brings together existing networks (such as PADAI, PEDRI and the cross-government participatory methods forum). Our working hypothesis is that an online meeting every two months; bringing together interested parties from central, devolved and local government, the wider public sector, and civil society, academia and the private sector; allowing people to share their work and also providing a space to work through common challenges, would be a good place to start.

The network is meeting on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an[ existing data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners. We’re also keen to explore offering you a public outlet for work going on in government, through blogposts or even a podcast.

Past and future meetings of the Community of Practice can be seen below. We will be meeting once a month from December 2024 - March 2025.
