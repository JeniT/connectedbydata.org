The [UN High Level Advisory Board on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/ai-advisory-body) is calling for new institutional arrangements to support the governance of AI that can deliver against the principle that AI should be governed “for all, by all”. 

In parallel, the [Coalition for a Global Citizens Assembly](https://www.gcacoalition.org/) have launched plans for a permanent Global Citizens’ Assembly, to address humanity’s greatest challenges.

**How could a Global Citizens Assembly on AI work?** That’s the question we’re setting out to explore, producing an options paper to be shared alongside the [UN Summit of the Future](https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future) in September 2024.

## Get involved

Between May and August 2024 we’ve been carrying out a series of interviews, focus groups and workshops to explore:

- **AI governance issues that a global citizens assembly could address;**
- **Design options for an inclusive global assembly** including if and how emerging technologies can be used to support the process;
- **Institutional structures and touch-points** including possible organisational models and  relationships for an assembly;
- **Strategic choices and theories of change** to ensure that an assembly gives citizens and communities a powerful voice in the governance of data and AI.

At the end of July we [shared and discussed](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-gca-oxford) a draft options paper.

Over August we invited further feedback and ran workshop sessions. In September we'll be publishing a final paper based on these discussions. 

## About the team

This is a collaborative process hosted by Connected by Data, working in partnership with [ISWE Foundation](https://iswe.org/). It is organised as a design lab under our [Growing Data Governance Communities grant from The Omidyar Network](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-growing-data-governance-communities).

This project is being coordinated by Tim Davies and Claire Mellier.
