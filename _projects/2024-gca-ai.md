The [UN High Level Advisory Board on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/ai-advisory-body) is calling for new institutional arrangements to support the governance of AI that can deliver against the principle that AI should be governed “for all, by all”. 

In parallel, the [Coalition for a Global Citizens Assembly](https://www.gcacoalition.org/) have launched plans for permanent Global Citizens’ Assembly, to address humanity’s greatest challenges.

**How could a Global Citizens Assembly on AI work?** That’s the question we’re setting out to explore, producing an options paper to be shared alongside the UN Summit for the Future in September 2024.

## Get involved

Over May and June we’re carrying out a series of interviews, focus groups and workshops to explore:

- **AI governance issues that a global citizens assembly could address;**
- **Design options for an inclusive global assembly** including if and how emerging technologies can be used to support the process;
- **Institutional structures and touch-points** including possible organisational models and  relationships for an assembly;
- **Strategic choices and theories of change** to ensure that an assembly gives citizens and communities a powerful voice in the governance of data and AI.

By the end of July we’ll produce a draft options paper for comment and feedback.

If you would like to get involved, please respond to our brief sign-up survey here, and we will be in touch with tim@connectedbydata.org.
