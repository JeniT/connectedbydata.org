**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** has been commissioned by the [Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF)](https://www.jrf.org.uk/) to improve their understanding of the current landscape and stakeholders they want to support, work with, influence and inspire as they create a [new insight and analysis infrastructure](https://www.jrf.org.uk/blog/how-we-approach-missing-data-could-unlock-social-and-economic-injustice) to help improve how the ecosystem understands inequalities, and how to solve them.

Between November 2022 and April 2023 we are carrying out desk research, surveying the field, and conducting interviews to map the ecosystem of users and beneficiaries of this insight infrastructure. Between January and April 2023 we will be running a number of workshops to create a shared vision for the insight infrastructure, and design an ongoing governance, stakeholder engagement and communications strategy. We are also supporting the JRF team as they develop their plans for, and implement, the infrastructure.
