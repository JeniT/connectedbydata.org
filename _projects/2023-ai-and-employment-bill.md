Connected by Data is proud to have contributed to that tradition as a special advisor to the Trades Union Congress’s groundbreaking [AI and Employment Bill initiative](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/ai-bill-project).

Created in collaboration with leading legal counsel and a multistakeholder group, the TUC’s Bill represents the best-in-class approach to regulating algorithmic management to protect and enhance the working lives of millions.
