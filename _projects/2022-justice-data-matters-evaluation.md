Connected by Data was been commissioned by [Justice Lab](https://justicelab.org.uk/) (a special initiative of the [Legal Education Foundation](https://thelegaleducationfoundation.org/)) to conduct an evaluation of the public deliberation exercise that led to the report [Justice Data Matters: Building a public mandate for court data use](https://research.thelegaleducationfoundation.org/research-learning/funded-research/justice-data-matters-building-a-public-mandate-for-court-data-use) in order to surface lessons for similar future exercises within and outside the UK justice system.

Between September and October 2022 we carried out interviews, looking at the literature on similar exercises, and produced a detailed report for Justice Lab to plan future work embedding public voice into the governance of justice data. We also organised a workshop to explore next steps for the Justice Lab as it aims to embed public participation into the governance of justice data.
