Connected by Data has been commissioned by the [Legal Education Foundation](https://thelegaleducationfoundation.org/) to conduct an evaluation of the public deliberation exercise that led to the report [Justice Data Matters: Building a public mandate for court data use](https://research.thelegaleducationfoundation.org/research-learning/funded-research/justice-data-matters-building-a-public-mandate-for-court-data-use) in order to surface lessons for similar future exercises within and outside the UK justice system.

Over September and October 2022 we are carrying out interviews, looking at the literature on similar exercises, and organising a workshop on next steps leading towards a brief public case study, and a detailed report for the Legal Education Foundationâ€™s to plan future work embedding public voice into the governance of justice data.
