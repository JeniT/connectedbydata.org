Data and AI are changing our world… community led campaigns can reshape how.

<!--more-->

Communities are affected daily by data governance decisions made by others, whether corporations, local and national government, or civil society organisations, at home, in education, and at work.

They may be made the target of damaging or biassed policies as a result of profiling; miss the opportunity to benefit from cutting edge research by being absent or underrepresented in key datasets; or feel caricatured and disenfranchised through the way data is collected about them. At the same time this is increasingly intensified through the use of AI and automated decision making built on this data, where a lack of transparency and accountability or redress has the potential for even great harms.

This project will be launching a 'Community Campaigns on Data' cohort. The cohort will bring together up to five different campaigns to explore together through monthly shared learning sessions, access to 1-to-1 advice, and bespoke expert input to advance community led campaigns on data. 

We’ll design the programme to meet participant needs, and expect to cover: 

* Engaging and mobilising communities around data and technology; 
* Creating compelling media stories on data issues; 
* Local and national policy engagement on data;
* Using data and legal rights as a campaign tool;
* Expert advice on in-depth technology issues.
