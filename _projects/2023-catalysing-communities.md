Communities are affected daily by data governance decisions made by others, whether corporations, local and national government, or civil society organisations, at home, in education, and at work.

They may be made the target of damaging or biassed policies as a result of profiling; miss the opportunity to benefit from cutting edge research by being absent or underrepresented in key datasets; or feel caricatured and disenfranchised through the way data is collected about them. At the same time this is increasingly intensified through the use of AI and automated decision making built on this data, where a lack of transparency and accountability or redress has the potential for even great harms.

This project aims to co-create and test methods for collective action on data. We will work in partnership with a range of groups and organisations to build capacity, insight and profile. This includes amplifying the experiences and actions of impacted communities through media, public affairs and the coalition of civil society organisations to win effective democratic data and AI rights for citizens and communities in the UK. 

We are particularly grateful to [Luminate](https://www.luminategroup.com/) for their generous help and support for this work.
