The People’s Panel on AI brought together 11^ representative members of the public randomly selected by the [Sortition Foundation](https://www.sortitionfoundation.org/) to attend, observe and discuss key events at the [AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/), which was held alongside the UK Government’s [AI Safety Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction) at the beginning of November 2023.

Through a deliberative process facilitated by [Hopkins Van Mil](http://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/), they produced a public report giving their verdict on AI and their recommendations to government, industry, civil society and academia for further action.
