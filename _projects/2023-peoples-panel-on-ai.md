Through a deliberative process facilitated by [Hopkins Van Mil](http://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/), they will produce a public report giving their verdict on AI and their recommendations to government, industry, civil society and academia for further action.

The People’s Panel on AI is being organised by [Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/) with support from the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/), the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/accelerate), the [Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public](https://www.kcesp.ac.uk/), and the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/).
