The People’s Panel on AI brought together representative members of the public to attend, observe and discuss key events at the [AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/), which was held alongside the UK Government’s [AI Safety Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction) at the beginning of November 2023.

Through a deliberative process facilitated by [Hopkins Van Mil](http://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/) the People's Panel on AI produced a public report giving their verdict on AI and their recommendations to government, industry, civil society and academia for further action.

## About the People's Panel on AI at the AI Fringe

The People’s Panel on AI in November 2023 was organised by [Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/) with support from the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/), the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/accelerate), the [Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public](https://www.kcesp.ac.uk/), and the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/).

We are currently exploring options to sustain and extend the work of the People's Panel, and welcome conversations about support for this activity.
