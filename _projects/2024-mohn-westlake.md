Communities are affected daily in both positive and negative ways by data governance decisions made by local and national governments. These arise through interactions with public services such as health and care; schooling; policing and justice; tax and benefits, as well as in more pervasive ways through government’s collection and dissemination of data, statistics and evidence to inform policymaking.

The use of data and AI within the public sector is essential for effective, evidence-based policymaking and for the efficient delivery of digital public services. Among other things, increasing use of data and AI promises opportunities to provide more joined-up healthcare; personalise education; tackle the courts backlog; and make it easier for citizens to access public services.

However, uses of data and AI can also be damaging to and contentious with the public. According to a recent survey, over half of people don’t trust local or central governments to keep their data safe, including being concerned about that data being shared or sold to the private sector. People may be made the target of damaging or biased policies as a result of profiling; miss the opportunity to benefit from cutting edge research by being absent or underrepresented in key datasets; or feel caricatured and disenfranchised through the way data is collected about them and their communities. This is intensified through the increasing use of AI and automated decision making built on this data, where a lack of transparency, accountability and redress has the potential for even greater harms.

Research on public attitudes on data finds that deliberation enables the public to navigate these tensions between risks and benefits with the necessary nuance. Citizens are generally happy for data to be used for public benefit, as long as safeguards are in place, and research by ADR UK and the Office for Statistics Regulation has found that “the public want to be involved in making decisions about whether public good is being served”. Public engagement exercises are already being run by the public sector, such as the £2m investment by DHSC for large scale public engagement. But these need to be scaled at the same rate as governments develop the use of data and AI to improve public services.

This programme of work, focused on the public sector, seeks to plug three main gaps:
* **Narrative:** The need for public participation in shaping the use of data and AI by the public sector is not universally recognised. Narratives often focus on individual consent as a mechanism for data governance, which is rarely suitable for public services. We need to develop shared terminologies, frameworks, arguments and stories that are effective in shifting public, political and civil service perceptions about the need for collective and participatory data governance within the public sector.
* **Practice:** Even if persuaded of the need for public participation, public bodies are often at a loss about how to do it. We need to develop good practice for collective and participatory data governance by public bodies and build a community of practitioners who can shape, procure and lead these activities.
* **Policy:** Existing policy and guidance such as the Code of Practice for Statistics, the GDS Service Manual or the Public Sector Procurement Policy do not incorporate processes to bring in public voice. We need to develop evidence-based public policy recommendations and language to create an environment that enables and encourages the public sector to engage in collective and participatory data governance.
