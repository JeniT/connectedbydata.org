    heading: But we shouldn't need to read pages of **terms and conditions** or spend ages configuring our **privacy preferences** or rejecting **cookies** to be treated decently. Who has the time?
  -
    heading: It shouldn't be our responsibility as individuals to prevent **wider impacts** to our societies on our own. These are collective problems.
  -
    heading: In any case, modern data processing **groups** us to make decisions about us, so it's often **other people's choices** about data that determine how it affects us.
