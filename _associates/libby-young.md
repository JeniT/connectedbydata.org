Libby researches the power and governance of data. She has a background in open data and data for social change, product, policy and communications in professional and financial services, and, further back, music. She holds an MBA from LBS, an MMus from GSMD and a BA(Hons) from USyd, and is currently a member of [ADM+S](https://www.admscentre.org.au/) and an associate of the [Sydney Policy Lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-policy-lab/).

As a PhD candidate in critical technology studies, co-supervised through Sydney Law School and Monash’s School of Media Studies, her current research considers personal data governance in democratic cultures, focused on the interrelated questions ‘what is personal data, and how should we use it?’.

Libby is working with us to research data stories and narratives.
