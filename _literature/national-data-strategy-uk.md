The National Data Strategy (NDS) is an ambitious, pro-growth strategy that aims to drive the UK in building a world-leading data economy while ensuring public trust in data use.

Data is now the driving force of the worldâ€™s modern economies. It fuels innovation in organisations large and small, across the private, public and third sectors.

The NDS is a framework for the action this government will take on data. It is not the final answer, but part of a conversation about the way we support the use of data in the UK.
