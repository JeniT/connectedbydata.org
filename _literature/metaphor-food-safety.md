We have choices about the food we eat, but we don't have to carry around chemical analysis units with us when we go food shopping to make sure it's not harmful. That's because there are regulations, and regulators, that limit what food providers do. When there is harm, it is dealt with quickly, and regulation is adjusted to keep up with changes to food manufacturing practices.

In the same way, we shouldn't have to be the ones scrutinising the organisations that collect and use data about us. Effective regulation and regulators are a better way of being protected from harm.
