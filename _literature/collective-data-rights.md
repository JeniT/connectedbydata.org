The harm to any one individual in a group that results from a violation of privacy rights might be relatively small or hard to pin down, but the harm to the group as a whole can be profound. Say Amazon uses its data on consumer behavior to figure out which products are worth copying and then undercuts the manufacturers of products it sells, like shoes or camera bags. Though the immediate harm is to the shoemaker or the camera-bag maker, the longer-term—and ultimately more lasting—harm is to consumers, who are robbed over the long run of the choices that come from transacting in a truly open and equitable marketplace. And whereas the shoemaker or camera-bag manufacturer can try to take legal action, it’s much tougher for consumers to demonstrate how Amazon’s practices harm them.
