There are three elements to the legitimate interests basis. It helps to think of this as a three-part test. You need to:

  * identify a legitimate interest;
  * show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and
  * balance it against the individualâ€™s interests, rights and freedoms.

The legitimate interests can be your own interests or the interests of third parties. They can include commercial interests, individual interests or broader societal benefits.
