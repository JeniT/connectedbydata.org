We can do a lot to our homes to make them our own, but there are limits. When we want to extend them, we have to go through a process that checks whether those changes will affect others in our neighbourhood. Elected representatives, supported by officials, carry out their deliberations in public and with transparency.

In the same way, we may have extensive rights over what we do with data that is about us, but there may also be times when others can make decisions about it for the common good.
