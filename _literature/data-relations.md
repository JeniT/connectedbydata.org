“In the digital economy, data isn’t collected solely because of what it reveals about us as individuals. Rather, data is valuable primarily because of how it can be aggregated and processed to reveal things (and inform actions) about groups of people. Datafication, in other words, is a social process, not a personal one. Further, it is a process that operates through a set of relationships. Only by highlighting the collective and relational character of datafication can we understand how it works, and the particular injustices that it produces. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise—it goes to the heart of what’s wrong with our digital world, and what may make it right.”
