When location data is linked with other data about people and the world we live in, we can gain important insights and create new services that greatly improve how we live, work and travel. With these new opportunities, there are also emerging privacy and ethical considerations. To continue to benefit from location data, it is important that these considerations are addressed, so that location data is used in a way that mitigates concerns and retains public confidence. Understanding public perspectives is key to this, as recognised in the UK’s Geospatial Strategy.

In March 2021, the Geospatial Commission and UK Research and Innovation’s Sciencewise programme commissioned Traverse and the Ada Lovelace Institute to deliver a public dialogue on the ethics of location data use.
