In collaboration with NHSX and the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care, the NIHR Applied Research Collaboration Greater Manchester commissioned a set of three online citizens’ juries about health data sharing in a pandemic between March and May 2021.

The juries each spent eight days listening to evidence and deliberating on three national data sharing initiatives which were introduced to tackle the pandemic. The juries concluded that the government was right to use emergency powers to share patient data during the Covid pandemic but greater transparency is needed.
