Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist at the University of Cambridge, was hired by Cambridge Analytica, an offshoot of SCL Group, to develop an app called "This Is Your Digital Life" (sometimes stylized as "thisisyourdigitallife"). Cambridge Analytica then arranged an informed consent process for research in which several hundred thousand Facebook users would agree to complete a survey for payment that was only for academic use. However, **Facebook allowed this app not only to collect personal information from survey respondents but also from respondents’ Facebook friends**. In this way, Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of Facebook users.
