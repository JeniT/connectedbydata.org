collective_focus: Through the OCAP principles, FNIGC places First Nations' voices
  and interests at the center of decision-making regarding data governance. In doing
  so, it transcends individual data subjects and government interests.

our_takeaway: 'FNIGC case provides learning on how a set of participatory principles,
  informed by past exploratory experiences, could result in governance structures
  and legal agreements that shape data processing within different initiatives.

  It illustrates how participation and inclusion are ongoing processes and how important
  it is to tackle them from different fronts (education, training, regulation, governance,
  and research).'
outcomes: 'An independent review completed by Harvard University’s Project on American
  Indian Economic Development in 2006 found that the RHS Phase 1 (2002/03) iteration
  of the survey “was unique in First Nations ownership of the research process, its
  explicit incorporation of First Nations values into the research design and in the
  intensive collaborative engagement of First Nations people … at each stage of the
  research process.” [1]

problem_and_purpose: '‘We’ve been researched to death’ has been said too many times
  by indigenous communities. The First Nations have been the subject of too much irrelevant
  research, with the majority of research projects initiated by, paid for and carried
  out by non-indigenous people from universities, government and industry. Accordingly,
  researchers have tended to select subjects of personal or academic interest, or
  of interest to the larger society, and have often not been interested in First Nations’
  priorities.


  The First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) is responsible for a wide
  range of work, from research and planning to surveys, capacity development, education,
  and training. FNIGC has been collecting data in First Nations communities using
  an approach built on an inherent respect for data sovereignty as embodied by the
  First Nations principles of OCAP® - ownership, control, access, and possession.
  OCAP® is self-determination applied to collective data, information and knowledge.'
process_description: 'FNIGC foundational work is the development and administration
  of national First Nations survey initiatives with regional partners - which include
  the First Nations Regional Health Survey (FNRHS), the First Nations Regional Early
  Childhood, Education, and Employment Survey (FNREEES), and the First Nations Labour
  and Employment Development (FNLED) survey. The First Nations principles of OCAP®
  assert that First Nations have control over data collection processes in their communities,
  they own the information, and dictate how this information can be used or accessed.
  All of FNIGC’s survey and research work is conducted in alignment with the OCAP®
  principles. 


  To achieve its goals, FNIGC leads education and training initiatives, engages in
  research and analysis, develops resources and tools, and works closely with regional
  partners.


  To give practical expression to these principles and values, the FNIGC also developed
  a set of governance and structural supports to ensure that data sovereignty was
  achieved and protected: 

  1. Code of research ethics: it requires approval by the national governing body
  for access to national level First Nations’ data, while access to regional-level
  First Nations’ data must be authorised by the regional First Nations organisations.
  Moreover, community-level data cannot be accessed without the direct consent of
  the First Nation involved;

  2. Privacy impact assessments;

  3. Cultural framework: it reconciles a First Nation or indigenous world view with
  the need to collect data and conduct research, by presenting a framework from which
  data on the health and wellbeing of First Nations can be collected, used and presented
  in a manner that is meaningful to First Nations peoples and communities.'

two_line_summary: FNIGC has been collecting data in First Nations communities using
  an approach built on an inherent respect for data sovereignty as embodied by the
  First Nations principles of OCAP - ownership, control, access, and possession. In
  collaboration with regional partners, FNIGC conducts unique data-gathering initiatives
  that enable partners to support First Nations governments to build culturally relevant
  portraits of their communities.
