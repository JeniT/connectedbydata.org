The Office for National Statistics has run a series of consultations to shape the design of Census data collection, and to determine priorities for the publication of census data and extracts. 

Individual census records are managed securely and the ONS produces and publishes statistical datasets broken down by geography,  demography and other variables. These data extracts are carefully designed to make sure that personal data is not accidentally revealed, and, because of the cost of producing and quality controlling each extract, only a subset of the theoretically possible breakdowns are ever produced are published.

The ONS used written consultation to gather feedback on priority extracts to create, categories to use, and how these should be labelled.
