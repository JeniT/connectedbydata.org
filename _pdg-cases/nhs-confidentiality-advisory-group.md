description: "Projects to process confidential patient data for health research, without

  following an application to the Health Research Authority (HRA). Applications are
  reviewed by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG), an independent body with both
  medical and 'lay' members. The Standard Operating Procedures of the group require
  that a lay member participates in each meeting. \n\nWhile ultimate decision making
  authority on data release rests with the HRA, it takes CAG advise into account. The
  CAG also provides advice to NHS Digital on sharing of identifiable information,
  and maintains a list of 'Precedent set pathways' for accessing confidential patient
  data for research.\n\nThe CAG seeks to operate transparently, publishing detailed
  minutes on its website, and a spreadsheet ‘Register of Approvals’.\n\nPreviously
  applications were assessed by the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG - 2001
  to 2008) and the Ethics and Confidentiality Committee (ECC - 2009 to 2013) which
  has now been replaced by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG)."

summary: "The NHS Confidentiality Advisory Group operates on a legislative basis and
  considers applications to access confidential patient information without explicit
  patient consent under the NHS Act 2006 and the Health Service (Control of Patient
  Information Regulations) 2002. It has both expert (medical professional) and lay
  members, recruited through an open application process. The role of expert and lay
  members of the committee are the same. \n\nApplications to the CAG are expected
  to show evidence of public involvement carried out by those applying for access
  to data that “specifically tests the acceptability of using confidential patient
  information without consent for the purpose of your activity”."
table: cases
takaway: "The CAG creates a space for citizen involvement in decision making, but
  remains an elite process. Information is transparent, but not necessarily easy to
  navigate and understand. \n\nWhere the CAG asks for evidence that affected communities
  have been consulted as part of the approval process, this has the potential to encourage
  a wide range of regulated data users to give greater consideration to participatory
  data governance."

title: NHS Confidentiality Advisory Group
whats_changed: Cross et. al (2020) examined feedback from the CAG in relation to a
  number of applications, and found evidence that CAG prioritised evidence of patient
  and public involvement (PPI) in incoming applications, with emphasis on "on an approach
  to PPI that was beyond tokenistic”. The CAG asked for evidence that representative
  of affected communities were included in PPI activities.
