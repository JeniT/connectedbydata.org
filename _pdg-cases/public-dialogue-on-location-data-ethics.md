collective_focus: 'The dialogue covered benefits and harms of location data. The report
  notes that participants tended to focus on collective benefits, but individual harms.
  They note that:


  > "this focus appears to be due to participants being concerned about the risks
  to themselves (and others) as individuals – something that we see often in public
  dialogue processes."

  and that:

  > Participants’ focus on location data about people may have been influenced by
  the dialogue design


  However, participants did raise collective concerns: such as data gaps leading to
  public transport plan excluding certain groups.'

The project describes findings primarily as able to inform future work:

> "The findings from this public dialogue can be used to inform research and practice in the following ways: 
> - to inform more trustworthy and responsible uses of location data, to build public confidence and support; 
> - to inform wider work and research on location data ethics, in academia, private and public sector; 
> - to inform future research strategy & policy that supports unlocking the value of location data; and 
> - to inform guidance for the private and public sector on the appropriate use of location data, and government’s future public engagement and communication approach on location data.

### Notable findings
The fourth and final finding of the dialogue was titled 'Enable Agency' and described:
> "Participants want more genuine ways to consent to and participate in ongoing data storage and use, and greater choice over how their data is used."
However, mechanisms for participation in ongoing data storage and use were not unpacked in the dialogue. The dialogue proposed a set of next steps, including further public engagement and research on:

> "How might organisations reframe the relationship with the public, giving them the opportunity to shift from being data subjects to data citizens, and providing choice over levels of involvement and engagement in their data choices?"

Trust occurs as a common theme in the findings, with individuals confidence in the use of location data various public entities (central government, other public sector organisations, NHS etc.) conditioned by their pre-existing trust in those institutions. 

For private sector uses of location data, participants were concerned about excessive for-profit exploitation of their location data, and about a perceived power imbalance between data subjects and holders. Transparency and accountability mechanisms were seen as important to address this. 

> "participants indicated that they felt it was generally easier to hold public sector and governmental data controllers to account, as the mechanisms for doing so are already built into society. If there was a data breach, or data was being misused, this may have political ramifications which could affect electoral outcomes, for example. When participants expressed feeling politically empowered, they were also more trusting towards public sector data controllers."

Participants placed significant emphasis on individual consent or data collection, and for re-use for anything other than public benefit:
> "To most participants, active, informed consent was a key requirement for most forms of individualised data collection. Consent was considered less essential for aggregate data or data used by the emergency services. However, when any type of individualised data is collected without a purpose that participants see as valid, such as for societal benefits or emergencies, it is through consent that the data becomes valid."
The dialogue appeared to provide relatively little support for new intermediary trust layers:
> "For some participants, the only person that can be ultimately trusted is themselves; therefore, having the ability to exercise control, to make choices, drives feelings of trust and security."
