collective_focus: "Many of the topics raised in the research map have a collective
  aspect, such as peer-groups, youth engagement, migration and provision of services
  to young people. \n\nHowever, the focus of the participation activity does not appear
  to have led to collective data governance being addressed directly. Instead, the
  goal has been to gather a diversity of perspectives from different communities and
  settings."

The GovLab, in partnership with UNICEF’s Health and HIV team in the Division of Data, Analysis, Planning & Monitoring and the **[Data for Children Collaborative](https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/)**, ran a rapid process to develop, refine and validate a topic map on research issues in Adolescent Mental Health, with the goal of informing the design and prioritisation of future	 data collaboratives. 

The process used desk research, two online workshops, and an online survey to workshop participants inviting them to select priorities from the co-developed topic map.
