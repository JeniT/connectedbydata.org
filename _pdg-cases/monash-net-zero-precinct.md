actor_responsible: future technology adoption in the Net Zero precinct

collective_focus: "Citizens are brought together to identify data governance concerns
  in relation to a smart city project, and to identify, prototype and evaluate future
  participatory tools, methods or processes that would allow a wider group of citizens
  to be engaged in ongoing data governance. \n\nWhile a number of the prototype ideas
  emphasise individual models of control over data (e.g. 'Your own data dashboard'),
  at least one (Participatory Planning) envisions greater transparency over proposals
  for data use, and encouraging citizens to think together about how data might be
  used, including incorporating discussion and voting features."

data_governed: "The Monash Net Zero initiative aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions
  for all four Monash University Campus sites by 2030. To do this, it is applying
  a range of smart-city, sensor network and data-rich technologies (including micro-grids),
  and using data visualisation and smart city technologies. \n\nIn this case, researchers
  worked with citizens to explore ways in which citizens could have greater engagement
  with data generated by, or useful to, the Net Zero initiative in a particular locality."
data_subject: Sensor networks, smart grids and other technologies that might be used
  to deliver a carbon Net Zero University.

description: "Researchers from Monash University in Australia carried out a series
  of participatory workshops, and a 'Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM)' exercise to identify
  promising approaches to deliver democratic engagement and citizen empowerment in
  the governance of data related to a smart-cities style Net-Zero Precinct project.\n\nThe
  project identified four of candidate designs for processes, tools or platforms that
  might support citizens to have greater oversight of, involvement in, or say over,
  the deployment of technologies including sensor networks, micro-grids, and other
  innovations that would help Monash University achieve net zero carbon emissions
  on its four campus locations by 2030. \n\nThere is no evidence to show whether or
  not these designs have been adopted."
