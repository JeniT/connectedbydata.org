collective_focus: The Call Detail Records Steering Committee in Ghana explored data
  governance through a collective approach by overcoming individual privacy notions
  to leverage the potential that data processing could have to tackle social issues
  (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and create more efficient public policies.

  \n\nAccording to Flowminder, one of its funders: \"The agreement has been the basis
  for a continued and successful partnership between the three parties. (...) The
  experience in Ghana offers several lessons that may be of use to others considering
  similar collaborations: \n1. Having the right conversations in advance is important.
  The GSS worked with partners and regulators to determine what the collaborative
  framework would be before it engaged with a data provider. \n2. Concerns about government
  access to sensitive data can be addressed by having a trusted third party assist
  with the data analysis. Academic partners or research institutes can be useful in
  this capacity. \n3. Having a formal agreement can address concerns about both the
  confidentiality of data and the availability of results. This example lays out terms
  for anonymization, aggregation, and limits on data access, while also allowing for
  openness and publication that is subject to review. \n4. An additional measure for
  protecting confidentiality is to require that individual- level data can only be
  accessed on the data provider’s servers by approved members of staff from approved
  third parties. \n5. Forming an agreement in advance can be valuable when facing
  an emergency. Thanks to the existing partnership, the GSS has been able to proactively
  use mobile data in its COVID-19 response efforts.\"\n\nSource: https://www.data4sdgs.org/sites/default/files/file_uploads/Ghana%2BCase%2BStudy_FINAL.pdf"

our_takeaway: Oversight of multiple stakeholder groups could provide institutional
  trust to address concerns about sharing sensitive data, allowing to unlock the value
  of data, particularly in times of crisis, such as Ghana's COVID-19 Response.
outcomes: "This collaborative decision-making structure has proven to be a critical
  complement to global standards, national laws, and legal agreements to govern data
  use._ _The project has developed a use case with the National Disaster Management
  Organisation; created legal and technical infrastructure for Call Detail Records
  data flows, and trained six Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) staff members as data
  scientists [1].\nThe Vodafone Foundation and Hewlett Foundation committed resources
  to the project for the first two years [2], and the agreement has been the basis
  for a continued and successful partnership between the three parties. However, no
  information about the Project after 2020 has been found.\n\n[1] <https://unstats.un.org/unsd/bigdata/conferences/2020/presentations/day1/session2/3.%20Omar%20Seidu.pdf>

problem_and_purpose: "In 2018, the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) created a 13-member
  Steering Committee to oversee the implementation of the Call Detailed Records (CDR)
  Project.\nThe goal of the CDR Project is to strengthen the capacity of the Ghana
  Statistical Service (GSS) to enable the Service to incorporate anonymised, aggregated
  mobile phone metadata from Vodafone Ghana into the production of official statistics
  [1].\nThe Terms of Reference of the Steering Committee include the provision of
  direction and guidance to ensure the success of the CDR Project, the development
  of data usage cases, the utilisation of results from key government institutions,
  as well as the implementation and capacity-building components of the project [1].\n\nThe
  partnership came out of the first UN World Data Forum held in Cape Town in January
  2017. The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) learned from Flowminder that Vodafone
  Ghana had previously tried to work with the Ghanaian Ministry of Health during the
  Ebola epidemic, but Ghana’s Data Protection Commission had stopped the project due
  to privacy concerns. However, because the GSS has a broader mandate for collaboration
  than the Ghanaian Ministry of Health, the parties expected the project to be more
  feasible this time around. In an effort to streamline the process and to determine
  which types of data collaborations were possible, as well as discuss issues of data
  security and individual privacy, the GSS held conversations with the Data Protection
  Commission, Ghana’s National Communications Authority, and Flowminder before connecting
  with Vodafone [2].\n\n[1] <https://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/steering-committee-to-oversee-implementation-of-cdr-inaugurated/>

process_description: 'The Call Detail Records Steering Committee (SC) is composed
  of senior representatives from the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), Vodafone, Flowminder,
  the Ministry of Planning, the National Communications Authority, and the National
  Development Planning Commission. It also includes non-governmental actors, such
  as representatives from the Telecoms Chamber and the Africa Digital Rights Hub.
  It was created to make decisions about who, beyond the government of Ghana, could
  access the Call Detail Records data [1]. The country now has a body to decide who
  else could access the data beyond the government of Ghana, therefore helping to
  explore the public value of mobile data further.

title: The Call Detail Records Steering Committee - Ghana
two_line_summary: "In Ghana, the Statistical Service (GSS) obtains mobile data (the
  Call Detailed Records - CDR) to produce official statistics based on an agreement
  with Vodafone Ghana, Vodafone Foundation, and Flowminder. To decide on requests
  for data from beyond the government (third parties), the GSS established a multistakeholder
  13-member Steering Committee.  \nThe Call Detail Records Steering Committee (SC)
  experience provides practical learnings for using a trusted third party to address
  concerns about government access to sensitive data."
whats_changed: The country now has a body to decide who else could access the data
  beyond the government of Ghana, therefore helping to explore the public value of
  mobile data to public policies.
