collective_focus: "The project has set up panels of young people with lived experience
  of depression and anxiety in three countries. \n\nPanels have been given formal
  decision making responsibilities in the project. \n\nThe MindKind pilot for the
  project has sought to explore what data people are happy sharing or not."

data_governed: Longitudinal data, giving insight into what helps prevent or treat
  anxiety and depression in young people. The data may be biological or behavioural.
  The data covers people aged 14 - 24.

evaluation_details: "The final report provides in-depth reflections on the practical
  implementation of the study's governance structure, covering power dynamics in an
  international team, supporting and integrating youth advisors and advisory groups,
  and external expert advisors. \n\nA mid-project governance survey found \"broad
  agreement among respondents that youth feedback was benefiting the project in meaningful
  ways\".\n\nReflections on the deliberative component of the project highlight where
  the design of materials facilitated understanding and dialogue, and some of the
  challenges in translating complex data topics into accessible language, particularly
  working across different national boundaries, and with participants with different
  levels of English as a first language."

governance_issues_description: 'Data should be available to researchers globally:
  with a need to balance privacy concerns with open science practice.


  The project needs a diversity of participants - including collecting data across
  geographical and cultural boundaries.


  The participants contributing data have lived experience of mental health challenges.'

our_takeaway: The MindKind project report provides a wealth of practical learning
  on embedding affected communities into the governance of a data project, and demonstrates
  ways to make complex issues of health data governance accessible through careful
  design and testing of materials for deliberative dialogue.

problem_and_purpose: "Remote mobile phone-based data collection offers a key opportunity
  to better understand lived experience of mental health. However, participation in
  app-based remote studies often drops off quickly. \n\nThe MindKind project hypothesised
  that \"young peoples’ willingness to participate in digital research is influenced
  by their ability to be involved in how their data is collected, shared, and used.\"
  [1] The MindKind project put the voice of young people with lived experience of
  mental health challenges at the heart of work to design and test the feasibility
  of a Global Mental Health Databank. \n<!--more-->\n## Background History and Context\nWellcome
  trust commissioned Sage Bionetworks (Sage) to carry out feasibility tests and prototype
  a global mental health databank (GMHD) to capture rich, longitudinal, electronically-derived
  data from young people with a focus on mental health, and to support research into
  the approaches, treatments, and interventions that may be relevant to anxiety or
  depression in 14-24 year olds."
process_description: "The project placed a focus on understanding appropriate models
  of data governance. The research project addressed the question of \"How do we create
  a data governance structure that gives real voice to youth?\" and worked with an
  initial set of principles:\n\n- \"Those banking their data shall have a high degree
  of involvement in decisions about the use of data and opportunities to act as citizen
  scientists. \n- The data collected shall be made readily accessible to a wide range
  of researchers under conditions that protect the privacy of research participants
  to the extent agreed upon by those banking their data and consistent with any legal
  requirements. \n- To support cutting-edge scientific research, there shall be sufficient
  ongoing engagement with those banking their data and with those who might analyse
  it to answer important research questions.\"\n<!--more-->\nWorking across three
  countries (India, South Africa, and the UK), the project established national Young
  People's Advisory Group (YPAG), and had a Professional Youth Advisor (PYA) working
  with each team, as well as a Global Youth Panel, and ad-hoc International Youth
  Panel. \nA Data Usability Advisory Group (DAUG) was also formed, bringing together
  researchers who may use the databank in their research, and to provide guidance
  on the usability of data collected. \nThese groups were consulted on potential data
  collection and governance strategies, with input used to design models for how potential
  youth contributors of data might engage with data governance through the project's
  platform and app. \nThese models were evaluated through a quantitative study, using
  a Randomised Control Trial design, and through a two-stage deliberative dialogue
  process exploring qualitative perspectives in each of the study countries."

title: 'MindKind: Global Mental Health Databank Pilot'
two_line_summary: "The MindKind project put the voice of young people with lived experience
  of mental health challenges at the heart of work to design and test the feasibility
  of a Global Mental Health Databank. \n\nWorking across three countries, the project
  involved youth advisors, young people's advisory panels, deliberative workshops
  and a randomised control trial to explore attitudes towards different models for
  governing collection and sharing of sensitive mental health data."
whats_changed: "The results of this engagement were used to produce an assessment
  against four ‘Go/No-go’ criteria, resulting in a judgement that the project was
  viable against ‘data governance and ethics’ and ‘data specification and structure’
  criteria, uncertain against criteria on engagement levels, and raising a ‘Stop’
  flag against ‘funding sustainability’ due to concerns about commercialisation of
  young people’s mental health data. \n\nFindings were also written up as a ‘data
  governance specification’ to be used in the design of any future stages of the databank
  development.\n\nAs of December 2022 we have not found evidence on the next steps
  of the Databank project, and how MindKind ultimately changes final project design
  or delivery."
