collective_focus: The outcomes of the COVID-19 mini-publics addressed a range of collective
  or community benefits from data sharing, and expressed concern for communities who
  might be under-represented in current data. They include recommendations for ongoing
  mechanisms that guarantee public oversight of data sharing and re-use action, and
  opportunities for public input and accountability. The recommendations highlight
  the need for a layered approach to participation, with publics, data intermediaries
  and data stewards all involved in data governance.

data_governed: "The COVID-19 assembly considered three examples of data re-use:\n\n-
  (Location Data) Re-use of aggregated/anonymised location data from mobile apps in
  order to understand adherence to lockdown policies, or to target enforcement activities.
  \n- (Transaction data) Re-use of credit card data within a sandbox environment to
  support government decision making in relation to the pandemic's economic impacts,
  and economic recovery.\n- (311 Data) Sharing of open data on response to reports
  of social distancing breaches and their resolution"

description: '> "The Data Assembly is an initiative from The GovLab supported by the
  Henry Luce Foundation to solicit diverse, actionable public input on data re-use
  for crisis response in the United States. The initiative began in the summer of
  2020 with an initial focus on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York
  City. The GovLab, New York Public Library, and Brooklyn Public Library co-hosted
  remote deliberations with three “mini-publics” featuring data holders and policymakers,
  representatives of civic rights and advocacy organizations, and New Yorkers from
  across the five boroughs."


  The motivation for hosting a data assembly is described as a desire to explore the
  balance between under- and over-sharing of data:


  > "A central difficulty in achieving this reconciliation is that policymakers and
  data holders often have little understanding of how different communities of users
  feel about the underlying issues—especially the trade-offs between risk and benefit
  that are inherent to data re-use. As a result, regulators and government leaders
  often find themselves torn between competing impulses. On the one hand, they may
  adopt sharing and re-use policies that could endanger privacy and other rights of
  users, particularly those from traditionally marginalized communities. On the other
  hand, excessive caution may severely limit the options for data re-use out of fear
  of violating those rights, curtailing the wider societal benefits. This conflict
  between over-sharing and not sharing enough is the central conundrum faced by data
  governance today."


  The mini-publics resulted in a Responsible Data Re-use Framework which was intended
  to inform both the work of policymakers and data holders, and to inform the development
  data literacy programmes with partners from New York Public Library and Brooklyn
  Public Library.'

summary: "The Data Assembly hosted discussions with three 'mini-publics', each representing
  different stakeholder groups (data holders and policy makers; rights groups and
  advocacy organisations; and citizens). The first two groups met via online meeting,
  to discuss a range of data re-use scenarios. The citizen group were engaged through
  an asynchronous online platform that invited response to key questions, and encouraged
  engagement with responses from other citizens. \n\nThe organisers synthesised findings
  into a Responsible Data Re-use Framework, designed to inform both the work of policymakers
  and data holders, and to inform the development of data literacy programmes with
  partners from New York Public Library and Brooklyn Public Library. This was presented
  at an 'online Townhall' meeting."

takaway: "The use of three separate mini-public approaches helped to:\n\n* ensure
  that engagement was aligned with different participants’ level of familiarity and
  experience; \n* avoid having the most experienced dominate the conversation; and\n*
  allow room for participants representing certain communities or constituencies often
  hard to reach through regular mini-publics to share their perspectives\n\nBy using
  mini-publics, organisations can promote more sophisticated deliberations around
  the use of data, responding to the concerns of additional stakeholders"
