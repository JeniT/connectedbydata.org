  a fair partnership between the NHS and researchers, charities and industry on the
  uses of NHS patients’ data and NHS operational data?’"


  The process covered:


  - **Benefits and motivations for data sharing** - including improved health outcomes,
  sharing knowledge and expertise, efficiency savings and revenue for NHS & enhanced
  reputations

  - **Concerns, cautions and risks** - including data security, inaccurate or inconsistent
  data collection, bureaucracy and additional demands on the system & financial and
  reputational risks

  - **The value of data** - including how to frame and realise value'

problem_and_purpose: "> In June 2019 Understanding Patient Data and NHS England in
  association with the Ada Lovelace Institute, commissioned Hopkins Van Mil to carry
  out a mixed methods public engagement process, exploring the question: ‘What constitutes
  a fair partnership between the NHS and researchers, charities and industry on the
  uses of NHS patients’ data and NHS operational data?’ \n> \n> The research was supported
  by the UK Government’s Office for Life Sciences. It was designed to ensure public
  views could feed into their developing policy framework for NHS Trusts entering
  into data access partnerships with third parties,1 which complements the Code of
  Conduct for data-driven health and care technology.2 The process involved three
  roundtable discussions with patient advocacy groups to develop materials and hone
  the research questions, followed by three citizens’ juries and a nationally representative
  online survey of over 2000 people.\n\n(Source: Summary report)\n\nThe detailed methodology
  report notes that:\n\n> \"the process design team and commissioning bodies worked
  hard to shift juror thinking away from individual levels of consent and control.
  The team asked ask jurors to reflect on how they would want these partnerships to
  work, how they should be designed and to systematically consider the issues inherent
  in their operation and governance.\""

two_line_summary: 'A mixed-methods public engagement process exploring the question:
  ‘What constitutes a fair partnership between the NHS and researchers, charities
  and industry on the uses of NHS patients’ data and NHS operational data?’.


  Three roundtable discussions with patient advocacy groups were used to develop materials
  and refine research questions. These were used in three citizens’ juries, and findings
  were validated through a 2000 person nationally representative online survey.'
whats_changed: "The recommendations have been published. As of project conclusion
  the funders write:\n\n> \"It is now for the UK government and NHS X to take action
  in order \tto meet these expectations.\"\n\n(Source: [Ada Lovelace Institute blog

  project’s final report was used amongst the inputs to the National Data Guardian’s
  2022 guidance on “[Evaluating public benefit when health and adult social care data
  is used for purposes beyond individual care](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1124013/NDG_public_benefit_guidance_v1.0_-_14.12.22.pdf)”."
