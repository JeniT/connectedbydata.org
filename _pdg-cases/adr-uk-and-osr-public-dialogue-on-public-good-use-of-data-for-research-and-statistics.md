collective_focus: Through a workshop agenda that posed the question “Does data use
  count as ’public good’ if some people benefit while others’ situation remains unchanged?”,
  participants were invited to explore situations in which the effects of data usage
  go beyond individual data subjects. That is exemplified by the “real-world needs”
  feedback from participants, in which they stated the need to use data to address
  needs in a way that could impact “future generations” or that only relate to a specific
  group (“a small number of people”).

our_takeaway: "While there are general principles (surfaced through this dialogue)
  that can guide experts to judge whether data use is aligned with the public good
  or not, there is strong public desire for ongoing engagement in making decisions
  about whether or not particular data use is actually serving public good. \nThe
  ADR UK public dialogue on ‘public good’ use of data for research and statistics
  provides practical learnings in (i) designing an inclusive recruitment process for
  participants from recruitment efforts to providing material prior to the workshops;
  and (ii) embedding citizens into the process of defining broad terms such as “public
  good” and “public interest”."
outcomes: 'The project concluded with five main findings from the feedback of participants:

  1\. Public Involvement: Members of the public want to be involved in making decisions
  about whether public good is being served;

  2\. Real-World Needs: Research and statistics should aim to address real-world needs,
  including those that may impact future generations and those that only impact a
  small number of people;

  3\. Clear Communication: To serve the public good, there should be proactive, clear,
  and accessible public-facing communication about the use of data and statistics
  (to better communicate how evidence informs decision-making);

  4\. Minimise Harm: Public good means data collected for research and statistics
  should minimise harm;

  5\. Best Practice Safeguarding: Universal application of best practice safeguarding
  principles to ensure secure access to data should help people feel confident to
  disclose data.

  At the time of writing we do not have evidence on how these findings have been taken
  forward. However, through the Project Advisory Group, and ADR UK Public Engagement
  Steering Group efforts were made to make sure a range of organisations would pay
  attention to the findings.'

problem_and_purpose: 'Administrative Data Research UK (ADR UK) was created in 2018
  to support researchers to access public sector data, with the goal of improving
  the availability of research for policy making [1]. 

  ADR UK described administrative data as “an invaluable resource for public good”,
  and work to facilitate researcher access to data, including sensitive data containing
  records on individuals. This requires making, and advising on, decisions about when
  data should or should not be shared, and how its use should be governed. 

  Under the UK Digital Economy Act (2017) legal framework, ‘public good’ (sometimes
  referred to as ‘public interest’ or ‘public benefit’) is broadly defined. Legal
  public good uses of data may include: to provide evidence for public policies, services
  or decisions which benefit our economy, society, or quality of life; to extend understanding
  of social, or economic trends and events; or to improve quality or understanding
  of existing or proposed research. [2].

  A 2018 consultation with professionals from the public and voluntary sectors by
  Involve, Understanding Patient Data, and the Carnegie UK Trust, generated a framework
  to evaluate whether public benefit has been delivered by a data sharing initiative
  in the context of health data. Their investigation recommended that the public ought
  to be part of these discussions to create a shared understanding of what public
  good means with regard to data use. [3].

  This principle was a key message from the 2022 Data and Analytics Research Environments
  UK dialogue with members of the public: that great efforts should be made to meaningfully
  include members of the public in decisions about how data about them is used. [4].

  Building on that work, ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK) and the Office for
  Statistics Regulation (OSR) formed a partnership in 2022 to explore public perceptions
  of ‘public good’ use of data and statistics.

process_description: The Administrative Data Research UK and the Office for Statistics
  Regulation, supported by Kohlrabi Consulting, carried out deliberative one-day workshops
  in London, Cardiff, Glasgow, Belfast, and one online workshop for those who were
  unable to join in person, with participants around the country in June 2022 to explore
  what the public perceive as ‘public good’ (or ‘public interest’) uses of data. In
  July 2022, a follow-up workshop with 10 participants from these earlier workshops
  reviewed and validated analysis of the first workshops, addressed questions raised
  by the Project Advisory Group, and explored practical application of the views raised
  to inform practical guidance.

title: ADR UK and OSR public dialogue on ‘public good’ use of data for research and
  statistics
two_line_summary: Building on recommendations from past engagement activities that
  the public should be part of discussions to create a shared understanding of what
  public good means with regard to data use, ADR UK commissioned deliberative one-day
  workshops in four UK cities (and one online). These fed into a follow up workshop
  with participants from earlier sessions, and resulted in a set of practical findings
  designed to inform future work on public good data use.
