description: "# Problem and purpose\nThe Home Office are overseeing a transformation
  in the data systems used in law enforcement, and wanted a mechanism to engage with
  civil society during the development of the project. They describe the 'Open Space'
  as intended to _\"to establish a productive space where the Home Office and civil
  society could have safe and productive conversations about the National Law Enforcement
  Data Programme (NLEDP)\"_\nThis operates in parallel to formal consultation channels.
  \n\n# Background history and context\nThe UK Home Office are developing a Law Enforcement
  Data Service (LEDS) and Home Office Biometrics (HOB) programme that will bring together
  formerly separate policing databases and provide new Automated Facial Recognition
  (AFR) capabilities. \nThe Police National Computer (PNC) has existed for over 45
  years, and contains criminal records. The Police National Database (PND) was created
  in 2007 and primary contains 'intelligence' records used by police forces. The HOB
  programme provides biometrics services used in law enforcement and immigration and
  asylum cases, as well as managing the National DNA Database.\nThis is a controversial
  development, and has a complex data governance structure including the National
  Law Enforcement Data Programme (NLEDP) Senior Leadership Team, Senior Responsible
  Officer, NLEDP Board, NDLEP Business Design Authority and OCiP (Operational Communication
  in Policing) as a voice of the police service within the project.\n\n# Organising
  and funding entities\nThe process was established the Home Office, and facilitated
  by Involve. 24 CSOs and Regulatory & Oversight Body participants participated in
  the workshops.\n# Methods and tools used\nBetween the start of the project in July
  2018, and the first 'annual report' in May 2020, 9 full or half-day workshop sessions
  took place. Background papers were prepared for each and circulated in advance.\nWorkshops
  involved presentations, plenary discussions and table discussions with Home Office
  representatives responsible for the areas under discussion, civil society organisations
  and other invited regulatory and oversight bodies. \n# What went on\nDiscussions
  took place on Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs); Custody Image Policy;
  Data Sharing; Data Quality; Data Retention; Individual Rights; Access Levels and
  Controls; the National Register of Missing Persons; Governance, oversight & inspection; 
  LEDS Code of Practice & training; Systems demonstrations; Audit process; and the
  overall Open Space process.\n\n# Outcomes, Impacts and Effects\nThe first annual
  report notes a number of areas where the discussion had an impact on developing
  policy, either as a result of helping the Home Office to understand concerns, improving
  the ways issues would be communicated, or informing decisions.\n\nThe report also
  notes a range of 'Sticking points and outstanding issues' where concerns from civil
  society remained.\n\nParticipation in the group appears to have been used by at
  least one CSO (Privacy International) to inform independent advocacy and campaigning
  on the NLEDP.\n\n# Analysis & Lessons Learned\nThe first annual report notes that
  24 civil society organisations have taken place in some or all of the Open Space
  workshops, but these organisations have not been identified. This was justified
  on the basis of allowing frank and open exchange of views. However, it means that
  little is reported about the particular groups whose interests were represented
  in the dialogue process. \nWhile background materials were intended to be confidential,
  one CSO participant (Privacy International) has published many of the documents
  on its website. \nAs of late 2022, there is no information available on the project
  website about what happened after mid-2020. Moreover, no additional information
  on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)."

summary: "The Home Office worked with Involve, a trusted independent public participation
  charity, to organise an ongoing 'Open Space' forum to engage civil society organisations
  in discussions around the integration of formerly disparate policing datasets and
  the development of biometric data analysis capabilities. The process allowed civil
  society a role in setting the agenda for discussions, which then took place through
  a series of workshop-style meetings.\n\nThe Open Space process has consisted of
  9 workshops (a mixture of half day and full day workshops), and papers produced
  by the Home Office or by Involve were circulated to CSOs at least two weeks prior
  to each workshop. \n\nThe participants agreed on a set of “working together” principles
  and the possibility of participants extending the scope of their activities ahead
  of the process."
table: cases
takaway: Engagement around a complex and controversial topic has been managed through
  a structured and predominantly closed-door process involving civil society organisations
  and regulatory and oversight bodies. Parallel public consultations took place on
  specific issues.

whats_changed: "The first annual report states that changes were made to the architecture
  for police database access to records from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
  (DVLA) as a result of discussions in the open space. \n\nParticipation in the Open
  Space appears to have supported one CSO, Privacy International, to pursue outside
  advocacy and to call for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \n\nNo information
  after the May 2020 annual report was found."

# Problem and purpose
The Home Office are overseeing a transformation in the data systems used in law enforcement, and wanted a mechanism to engage with civil society during the development of the project. They describe the 'Open Space' as intended to _"to establish a productive space where the Home Office and civil society could have safe and productive conversations about the National Law Enforcement Data Programme (NLEDP)"_
This operates in parallel to formal consultation channels. 

# Background history and context
The UK Home Office are developing a Law Enforcement Data Service (LEDS) and Home Office Biometrics (HOB) programme that will bring together formerly separate policing databases and provide new Automated Facial Recognition (AFR) capabilities. 
The Police National Computer (PNC) has existed for over 45 years, and contains criminal records. The Police National Database (PND) was created in 2007 and primary contains 'intelligence' records used by police forces. The HOB programme provides biometrics services used in law enforcement and immigration and asylum cases, as well as managing the National DNA Database.

# Organising and funding entities
The process was established the Home Office, and facilitated by Involve. 24 CSOs and Regulatory & Oversight Body participants participated in the workshops.
# Methods and tools used
Between the start of the project in July 2018, and the first 'annual report' in May 2020, 9 full or half-day workshop sessions took place. Background papers were prepared for each and circulated in advance.
Workshops involved presentations, plenary discussions and table discussions with Home Office representatives responsible for the areas under discussion, civil society organisations and other invited regulatory and oversight bodies. 
# What went on
Discussions took place on Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs); Custody Image Policy; Data Sharing; Data Quality; Data Retention; Individual Rights; Access Levels and Controls; the National Register of Missing Persons; Governance, oversight & inspection;  LEDS Code of Practice & training; Systems demonstrations; Audit process; and the overall Open Space process.

# Outcomes, Impacts and Effects
The first annual report notes a number of areas where the discussion had an impact on developing policy, either as a result of helping the Home Office to understand concerns, improving the ways issues would be communicated, or informing decisions.

The report also notes a range of 'Sticking points and outstanding issues' where concerns from civil society remained.

Participation in the group appears to have been used by at least one CSO (Privacy International) to inform independent advocacy and campaigning on the NLEDP.

# Analysis & Lessons Learned
The first annual report notes that 24 civil society organisations have taken place in some or all of the Open Space workshops, but these organisations have not been identified. This was justified on the basis of allowing frank and open exchange of views. However, it means that little is reported about the particular groups whose interests were represented in the dialogue process.
