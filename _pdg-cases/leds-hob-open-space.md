  2020 FINAL.pdf
collective_focus: The Open Space experience explored data governance through collective
  lens by acknowledging that data processing impacts specific groups differently (such
  as children and immigrants), a debate that was raised in many workshops and, as
  a result, is now part of the Home Office agenda.

our_takeaway: Engagement around a complex and controversial topic has been managed
  through a structured and predominantly closed-door process involving civil society
  organisations and regulatory and oversight bodies. Parallel public consultations
  took place on specific issues.
outcomes: "The first annual report notes a number of areas where the discussion had
  an impact on developing policy, either as a result of helping the Home Office to
  understand concerns, improving the ways issues would be communicated, or informing
  decisions.\nThe report also notes a range of 'sticking points and outstanding issues'
  where concerns from civil society remained.\nParticipation in the group appears
  to have been used by at least one CSO (Privacy International) to inform independent
  advocacy and campaigning on the NLEDP.\n<--more-->\n## Analysis and Lessons Learned\nThe
  first annual report notes that 24 civil society organisations have taken place in
  some or all of the Open Space workshops, but these organisations have not been identified.
  This was justified on the basis of allowing frank and open exchange of views. However,
  it means that little is reported about the particular groups whose interests were
  represented in the process. \nWhile background materials were intended to be confidential,
  one CSO participant (Privacy International) has published many of the documents
  on its website. \nAs of early 2023, there is no information available on the project
  website about what happened after mid-2020. Moreover, no additional information
  on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)."

problem_and_purpose: "The Home Office are overseeing a transformation in the data
  systems used in law enforcement, and wanted a mechanism to engage with civil society
  during the development of the project. They describe the 'Open Space' as intended
  _\"to establish a productive space where the Home Office and civil society could
  have safe and productive conversations about the National Law Enforcement Data Programme
  (NLEDP)\". _This operates in parallel to formal consultation channels. \n<--more-->\n##
  Background History and Context\nThe UK Home Office is developing a Law Enforcement
  Data Service (LEDS) and Home Office Biometrics (HOB) programme that will bring together
  formerly separate policing databases and provide new Automated Facial Recognition
  (AFR) capabilities. \nThe Police National Computer (PNC) has existed for over 45
  years, and contains criminal records. The Police National Database (PND) was created
  in 2007 and primary contains 'intelligence' records used by police forces. The HOB
  programme provides biometrics services used in law enforcement and immigration and
  asylum cases, as well as manages the National DNA Database.\nThis is a controversial
  development, and has a complex data governance structure including the National
  Law Enforcement Data Programme (NLEDP) Senior Leadership Team, Senior Responsible
  Officer, NLEDP Board, NDLEP Business Design Authority and OCiP (Operational Communication
  in Policing) as a voice of the police service within the project."
process_description: "The process was established by the Home Office, and facilitated
  by Involve. 24 CSOs and Regulatory & Oversight Body participants participated in
  the workshops.\nBetween the start of the project in July 2018, and the first 'annual
  report' in May 2020, 9 full or half-day workshop sessions took place. Background
  papers were prepared for each and circulated in advance.\nWorkshops involved presentations,
  plenary discussions and table discussions with Home Office representatives responsible
  for the areas under discussion, civil society organisations and other invited regulatory
  and oversight bodies. \nDiscussions took place around Data Protection Impact Assessments
  (DPIAs); Custody Image Policy; Data Sharing; Data Quality; Data Retention; Individual
  Rights; Access Levels and Controls; the National Register of Missing Persons; Governance,
  oversight & inspection; LEDS Code of Practice & training; Systems demonstrations;
  Audit process; and the overall Open Space process."

title: LEDS/HOB Open Space
two_line_summary: The Home Office organised an ongoing 'Open Space' forum to engage
  CSOs in discussions around the integration of policing datasets and the development
  of biometric data analysis capabilities. The process allowed civil society a role
  in setting the agenda for discussions, which then took place through a series of
  workshop-style meetings.
whats_changed: "The first annual report states that changes were made to the architecture
  for police database access to records from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
  (DVLA) as a result of discussions in the Open Space. \nParticipation in the Open
  Space appears to have supported one CSO, Privacy International, to pursue outside
  advocacy and to call for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \nNo information
  after the May 2020 annual report was found."
