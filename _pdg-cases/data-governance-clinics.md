In two data governance clinics run by academics from the University of Tilberg for projects in the city of Amsterdam, leaders of projects facing data governance questions were supported to think through their projects, using a facilitated discussion. 

The process helped project engineers and leaders to formalise a conception of how their work served the public interest, and to assess:

- How to secure acceptance of a specific controversial project (clinic 1); and
- How to decide whether or not to engage with a new data source (2).
