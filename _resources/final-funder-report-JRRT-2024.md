At the conclusion of our [JRRT](https://www.jrrt.org.uk/) funded project, [Seizing The Moment](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-jrrt-influencing), we submitted a final report to them about the achievements, how the grant helped, what didn't work and lessons we've learned. We open this report here to share that learning.
