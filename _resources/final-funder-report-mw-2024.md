With three months to go of our [Mohn Westlake Foundation](https://www.themohnwestlakefoundation.co.uk/) funded project, [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), we submitted a final report with our reflections on whether the purpose of the grant was achieved, what we learned, information about the beneficiaries, and the overall impact. We open this report here to share that learning.
