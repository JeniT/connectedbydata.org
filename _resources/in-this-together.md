Building on conversations started at our [Policy Design Lab in June 2023](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-06-04-policy-design-lab) this paper, co-written by MyData Global, Connected by Data, Aapti Institute and The Datasphere Initiative, explores notions of individual data rights and collective data governance, and looks at how the apparent tensions and ambiguities between the two can be resolved to enhance advocacy for better data governance.
