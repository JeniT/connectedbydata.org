This story was produced drawing from the brainstorming ideas generated by the participants of our interactive session “Data to the people: reflecting on participation and inclusion in AI uses for healthcare”, held at the “Beyond Data Protection Conference: Regulating Information and Protection against Risks of the Digital Society,” in September 2023.

Our special thanks to all the brilliant participants who actively engaged in our session.
