This is our response to the Government's consultation around its AI White Paper: [A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper). Our main points are:

* The development and deployment of AI systems presents significant opportunities and threats to individuals, groups, and the broader public interest, including economic growth and the health of democratic processes. Near-term harms and benefits must not be overlooked through an overfocus on remote and extreme risks.
* The positive opportunities of AI for public benefit can only be achieved through the co-design of a regulatory regime that incorporates a wide range of perspectives, disciplines and interests: both when rules and principles are set, and when they are operationalised. This will enhance trust, strengthen outcomes, drive innovation and adoption, and anticipate and manage risks. 
* The UK government’s ‘A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation’ white paper acknowledges the importance of hearing and considering public voice. However, there is no indication about how this will be implemented or the findings from it enforced either by regulators or by AI developers and users.
* The white paper fails to give sufficient legal and financial power and capabilities to the sector regulators who are the backbone of its regulatory approach. It also neglects the role of civil society groups as drivers of accountability, including for the public sector’s own use of data and AI.
* These omissions have created an unbalanced, narrow and technocratic proposal that has already been outpaced by political and technological developments.
* A renewed approach is needed that offers a positive framework for the development of cross-cutting AI technologies geared towards the most pressing socio-economic issues. Giving communities a powerful voice in this process will be critical to this approach.
