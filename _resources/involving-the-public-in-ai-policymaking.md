Public voice is crucial for shaping an AI future that is trustworthy, trusted and operating for public good. In November 2023, the Peopleâ€™s Panel on AI demonstrated the feasibility, utility and value of a deliberative review in providing that voice.

This report summarises the process and findings of the People's Panel and makes the case for future summits, conferences and AI governance discussions to integrate deliberative public participation, enabling  mini-publics to observe, interrogate and publicly review AI debates and decisions.
