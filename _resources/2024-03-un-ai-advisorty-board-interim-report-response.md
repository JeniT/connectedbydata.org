In January the UN Secretary-General's [AI Advisory Body](https://www.un.org/ai-advisory-body) launched its [Interim Report: Governing AI for Humanity](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/un_ai_advisory_body_governing_ai_for_humanity_interim_report.pdf) and invited feedback to support drafting of the final report. 

We produced this consultation response, focussing on the need for institutional arrangements that can implement the report's first guiding principle: AI that is "governed inclusively, by and for the benefit of all".
