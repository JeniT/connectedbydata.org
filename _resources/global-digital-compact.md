The UN Secretary General has called for a Global Digital Compact to be agreed at the Summit of the Future in September 2024. The Compact is expected to “outline shared principles for an open, free and secure digital future for all”. 

In early 2023, the Office of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Technology is hosting an open consultation on principles that should feature in the Compact. 

**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** intend to submit a brief response under the data protection theme on 30th April.

We welcome feedback on this draft via Google Docs comments.
