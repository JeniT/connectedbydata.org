The [Data Values Project](https://www.data4sdgs.org/data-values-project-public-consultation) white paper “[Reimagining Data and Power: A roadmap for putting values at the heart of data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGWzdMxClZgwhkSdh24XPLXm7Z1P_Yh7H9PSqnym2Dg/edit?usp=sharing).” was published in May 2022. The paper aims to provide conceptual clarity to key themes emerging from discussions, research, and interviews carried out by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data with stakeholders across the development sector.

The paper explores issues of individual and collective data governance, and places an emphasis on participatory approaches to data design, collection, management and use. 

The Data Values Project have asked for feedback on the paper as part of a broad consultation.

This working draft contains a response from Connected by data to the white paper and consultation call.
