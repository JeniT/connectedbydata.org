“The Data Values campaign is a global movement to challenge power structures in data to ensure that we all share in the benefits from its collection and use.” The campaign sets out a five point manifesto that builds on the Reimagining Data and Power whitepaper, both developed through broad global consultation. Together, these documents provide a framework describing the kinds of actions that governments, companies, civil society organisations, donors, and others should undertake to transform how data is funded, designed, managed, and used, and to put people and communities at the heart of data systems. 

The changes that the Data Values campaign seeks to secure are ambitious, achievable and, to an extent, measurable. This policy brief explores how the Global Data Barometer can be deployed to support insight and measurement of data values at the country level: supporting efforts in both advocacy, and accountability.
