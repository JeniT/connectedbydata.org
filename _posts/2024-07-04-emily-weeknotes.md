### What I’ve been doing
Voting! And so should you be if you haven’t already (and you’re reading this when there’s still time). Whoever you vote for, just vote. And for the record, not voting is still participating so don’t tell yourself you’re sitting it out - you’re having an impact, potentially an undesired one.

We had a great pre-election policy debate and the [recording is available to watch here](https://youtu.be/gZ-tdt74-KA). There’s [a write up on our website](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-25-general-election-event) and [a summary ‘thread’](https://x.com/ConnectedByData/status/1808145684337484238) on our socials too. 

Our [Annual Report was published this week](https://connectedbydata.org/annual-report/2023/) and its a wonderful overview of all we’ve been up to in the last twelve months, when “AI” exploded into the narrative.  It’s worth a cup of tea and a read in my humble opinion (and do shout if there’s bits you’d like to know more about or get involved with).

I’ve been trying to keep us focussed on the reality of our capacity and demands over the next three months which always feels a little bit like you’re trying to block opportunities (often exciting ones). But even just asking the question is better for everyone (and it’s even better if I can get us to sometimes say ‘no thank you’).

I’m continuing to work on improving the operationalisation of our approach to fundraising. I think part of the challenge is different team members wanting slightly different things and I feel a real risk around this that it feels like “more work” (which of course it is but…). I haven’t got the balance right for everyone yet.


### What I need to take care of
We’ve selected the participants for the Public Voices in AI People’s Advisory Panel and have the first meeting of that next week.

We got VAT registered in this financial year and it is time for our first VAT return - another learning curve!

I should finish monthly reconciliation after posting these and will tackle Q1 (April - June) objectives reporting next week.  

Outside of work I’ve got an x-ray on a dodgy shoulder on Tuesday. It’s kind of been rushed through (contrary to what seems to be the advertised NHS overwhelm).  It’ll be interesting to learn the results.


### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
I ought to note here that the Bookkeeping and Controls Part 1 exam I took a while back has been marked and I passed, with distinction. So that’s pleasing. Part 2 next…

A colleague, [Gavin](https://connectedbydata.org/people/gavin-freeguard), recently hosted (as part of London Data Week) ‘The Data Game’ and I particularly enjoyed [the ‘Blankety Blank’ element](https://youtu.be/xBNyzYHOKUY?si=QLVxkvUvN2Pka7NA&t=6834) with humans competing against generative AI.  Some of the answers the Gen AI gave were quite enlightening!


### What I’ve been reading
Also from Gavin I [read his thoughts](https://t.co/fWVIDwRKe4) on using a conventional library analogy to help think through Labour’s National Data Library pledge. Trust around data is so important and librarians are the third most trusted profession so there could be a very beneficial link between conventional libraries and Labour’s proposed National Data Library. If I set aside my struggles with the primary framing of conventional libraries as collections / repositories and consider this as a British Library / other National Libraries specific analogy - then I think there’s some interesting points made by Gavin and I wonder whether the library sector is considering its role / skills here and gearing up for what it could do.

I finished Susie Chan’s book. Unsurprisingly I loved this motivational book which I already know I’ll read again (perhaps in training when I enter another ultramarathon). It’s very much Susie’s voice, well paced and with great humour.
