Hello, and welcome to our 24th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments, with something of a back-to-school feel - though it’s not as if, for those of us following data and AI policy, it feels like there was much of a break at all.

<!--more-->

MPs will be easing back into Westminster with [a debate - TODAY - on technology in public services](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48650). [We’ve produced a short briefing](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/technology-in-public-services) that might be handy for the parliamentarians in your life, or if you expect to be glued to BBC Parliament or Parliament TV this afternoon. The Commons Library [have also got you covered](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2024-0115/).

The blue sky of summer [sic] may be receding into the past, but the Bluesky of social media may be the future. A reminder you can follow [Connected by Data](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.bsky.social) there, along with most of the team - [Jeni](https://bsky.app/profile/jenit.bsky.social), [Tim](https://bsky.app/profile/tgdavies.bsky.social), [Adam](https://bsky.app/profile/adamc-c.bsky.social), [Emily](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjmacaulay.bsky.social), [me](https://bsky.app/profile/gavinfreeguard.bsky.social). We’ve also pulled together [a starter pack](https://go.bsky.app/FDKqcty) and [list](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3fgba6fhuyscv52hpegdxerq/lists/3l27onhfgl22f) of members of [the Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) who’ve joined the X-odus and migrated there - [give me a shout](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com) if we’ve missed you (or you’d like to join).

## **Data policy developments** {#data-policy-developments}

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}

**Digital Information and Smart Data Bill (DISD)** We’re still waiting to hear when this bill will come to parliament - rumours suggest it could be some time in the autumn, though Politico Morning Tech UK says it’s ‘unlikely’ to come before party conference recess - and how much of the old Data Protection and Digital Information Bill will make it through.

That doesn’t mean it’s been quiet… 

**Algorithmic transparency** (included in the original consultation, the subject of several DPDIB amendments) [Warnings AI tools used by government on UK public are ‘racist and biased’: Transparency campaigners welcome government move to publish details of system algorithms](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/25/register-aims-to-quash-fears-over-racist-and-biased-ai-tools-used-on-uk-public) (The Observer) **Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner** (DPDIB planned to abolish the post, so the most recent appointment had been made with that in mind) [Resignation of the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/resignation-of-the-biometrics-and-surveillance-camera-commissioner) (UK Government)... [Police Digital Service taps up former biometrics commissioner as interim CEO](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366608632/Police-Digital-Service-taps-up-former-biometrics-commissioner-as-interim-CEO) (Computer Weekly)... **Postcode Address File** (subject of an amendment to DPDIB) [FOI release: Royal Mail's view on a House of Lords proposal for open address data in the UK](https://www.owenboswarva.com/blog/post-addr6.htm) (Owen Boswarva)... [This confidential government report proves that we need to liberate the Postcode Address File](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/secret-paf-report) (James O’Malley)... **Things that are definitely going to be covered by the new Bill** [An introduction to the NUAR Data Model](https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/08/13/an-introduction-to-the-nuar-data-model/) (Geospatial Commission)... [No, the government isn't planning to introduce ID cards: What the government is actually planning for digital ID](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/trust-but-verify) (James O’Malley)...

And the most important bit of bill news… thanks to those who completed our poll on how we should abbreviate the new Bill. The winner was **DISD, pronounced ‘dissed’**, with ‘dizzed’ in second and DISDaB and DISD-ee in joint third(/last). I’m not sure where [this](https://bsky.app/profile/chsmith.bsky.social/post/3kzmdso45oi2u) would have finished.

**AI Bill** We’re waiting for a date on this one as well, with conflicting rumours on whether it’ll be later this year/early next. Plenty of government-related AI news in the DSIT section, below.

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill** We await a date (Politico says this one is also unlikely before conferences kick off) but as we noted [last time out](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/08/08/data-policy-digest), this may come sooner rather than later.

### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}
It’s summer, they said. It’ll be quiet, they said. It’ll be the first proper August [silly season](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/29/heinz-spaghetti-carbonara-canned) for years, they said.

Not in data, AI and tech policy…

#### **The non-digital centre of government** {#the-non-digital-centre-of-government}
Let’s start with things occupying No 10, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury that will have an impact.

The PM gave a speech on ‘[fixing the foundations of our country’](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/keir-starmers-speech-on-fixing-the-foundations-of-our-country-27-august-2024), which included this line: ‘We’ll move forward this autumn with harnessing the full potential of AI, for growth and the public good.’ He also visited Germany, [Prime Minister to drive UK growth on European visits as he launches major German partnership](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-to-drive-uk-growth-on-european-visits-as-he-launches-major-german-partnership), with a new treaty (to be negotiated over next six months) expected to include ‘critical science, innovation and tech’. There have also been reports of tensions in Downing Street - [Britain’s most powerful woman goes to war](https://www.politico.eu/article/chief-of-staff-sue-gray-labour-party-keir-starmer-british-politics) (Politico)... [Downing Street fights charge Sue Gray is creating ‘bottleneck’](https://www.ft.com/content/70044bcb-3468-4192-8e70-e90221c6b1b5) (FT)... [‘Look out for fireworks’: power struggle rumours between No 10 big beasts persist](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/no-10-power-struggle-rumours-sue-gray-morgan-mcsweeney) (The Guardian) - which have touched on special adviser and similar appointments.

[Last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/08/08/data-policy-digest) we noted the controversy around some appointments, including at DSIT. That story has continued to run… [Did the Civil Service Commission know about Emily Middleton’s “political activity” when they approved her role?](https://whitehallproject.substack.com/p/did-the-civil-service-commission) (Henry Newman)... [Glen urges Civil Service Commission to investigate alleged 'cash for jobs' appointments](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/civil-service-commission-investigate-john-glen-labour-civil-service-appointments) (CSW)... [Civil Service Commission to review appointments made by exception at delegated grades](https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/civil-service-commission-to-review-appointments-made-by-exception-at-delegated-grades/) (Civil Service Commission)... [UK Labour faces a scandal of its own making](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-labour-faces-a-scandal-of-its-own-making/) (Politico)... and Politico also reports that ‘the previously anticipated appointment of Tony Blair Institute director Jeegar Kakkad’ to be a special adviser to Pat McFadden ‘appears to have been held up’, but the MInister for the Cabinet Office has made [some other appointments](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/starmer-gets-a-bit-of-friday-heat/). Meanwhile mySociety has made the [latest register of MPs’ interests data available in a spreadsheet](https://www.mysociety.org/2024/08/20/new-register-of-interests-spreadsheet-with-much-richer-data/) with much richer data,, so you can see who has donated to whom.  

There’s a spending review coming, which will set out public spending plans… ‘Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has now written to cabinet ministers ordering them to find reforms and deploy technology that can save cash’ was [The Observer’s take](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/11/chancellor-rachel-reeves-treasury-budget-tough-spending-decisions)…  [Departments asked to find tech efficiencies in spending review](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/08/20/government-and-politics/departments-asked-to-find-tech-efficiencies-in-spending-review/) was Public Technology’s summary… while the Observer also had a piece on how [Britain could be a sci-tech superpower – if the Treasury stopped holding it back](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/25/britain-could-be-a-sci-tech-superpower-if-the-treasury-stopped-holding-it-back). 

The Times had a piece on the government’s proposed ‘mission control’ for tracking delivery of its priorities, [Keir Starmer’s No 10 nerve centre has echoes of Dominic Cummings](https://www.thetimes.com/article/737bdf78-299a-4f2e-ba8e-30a4c20b5dae?shareToken=95a91bc566bc84edf367468a356b9027). Cue interesting responses from [Rachel Coldicutt](https://bsky.app/profile/rachelcoldicutt.bsky.social/post/3l2h24k3dln27), [David Henig](https://bsky.app/profile/davidheniguk.bsky.social/post/3l2h4iizlpp25), [Ciaran Martin](https://bsky.app/profile/ciaranm.bsky.social/post/3l2h67nqhyg27), [Mark O’Neill](https://bsky.app/profile/radiobeartime.com/post/3l2h35g7hst2w), [James Plunkett on dashboards](https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/dashboards-or-not-cf1979ac44c4) and no doubt others I’ve missed.

#### **The digital centre of government** {#the-digital-centre-of-government}

Moving to DSIT… I’m one of the people discussing the efforts to make DSIT the digital centre of government in [Refreshing the homepage: Experts discuss the pros and cons of the digital government shake-up](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/08/30/government-and-politics/refreshing-the-homepage-experts-discuss-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-digital-government-shake-up/) (Public Technology) 

**Opportunity, knocked** Let’s start with AI. In our [last edition](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/08/08/data-policy-digest) we mentioned the AI Opportunities Unit and Matt Clifford being tasked with drawing up an [action plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-ai-opportunities-action-plan-terms-of-reference). [DSIT tweets](https://x.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1824355473191063704) suggested they were engaging with some people outside government, but [not parts of civil society](https://x.com/rachelcoldicutt/status/1824361274039312774), which led to [quite the debate](https://x.com/JeniT/status/1824743006588867009). (And the government’s approach to civil society in other briefs may be [worth watching](https://bsky.app/profile/alasdairmackenzie.bsky.social/post/3l2helmzen62i).) Politico Morning Tech UK also noticed [unhappy start-ups underneath a DSIT post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scitechgovuk_our-tech-sector-the-third-largest-globally-activity-7224428950037364737-u8Yr/). 

We’re hoping to have Matt Clifford at a forthcoming meeting of the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) - in the meantime, you can email your thoughts on the action plan to [aiactionplan@dsit.gov.uk](mailto:aiactionplan@dsit.gov.uk) (though do it quickly, we’re expecting something to be published soon). [Form Ventures](https://formventures.substack.com/p/ai-policy-for-the-application-layer) and [Air Street Capital](https://press.airstreet.com/p/rediscovering-the-uks-ai-ambition) have published their submissions to the review - let us know if you’ve spotted any others.

**Automation, automation, automation** While we’re on the subject of who’s influencing the new government’s tech policy… Politico had a piece on [Tony Blair’s AI mania sweeps Britain’s new government](https://www.politico.eu/article/tony-blairs-ai-mania-sweeps-britains-new-government/) (which may have [a long shelf life](https://bsky.app/profile/richardpope.org/post/3l22mhjik3b27)). It came a few days after [a thread from Jeni on tech-utopianism](https://x.com/JeniT/status/1823276006288875542) which may have mentioned his Institute for Global Change. TBI also published new reports, [Reimagining Procurement for the AI Era](https://www.institute.global/insights/public-services/reimagining-procurement-for-the-ai-era) and [Preparing the NHS for the AI Era: A Digital Health Record for Every Citizen](https://www.institute.global/insights/public-services/preparing-the-nhs-for-the-ai-era-a-digital-health-record-for-every-citizen); health policy journo Andy Cowper was [critical](https://bsky.app/profile/njdavies.bsky.social/post/3l2omvy6oas2t) of some of the thinktank’s work on health and data/AI; and the man himself was in the Observer talking about his new book on leadership, with a bit on AI and digital ID: [Tony Blair: ‘I would have stayed if I could, is the truth’](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/01/tony-blair-on-leadership-book-interview-starmer-ai-trump).

**Everything else** [DataConnect](https://events.ringcentral.com/events/dataconnect-2024/registration) - a week-long virtual festival for public sector data leaders - is happening later in September (our very own Tim will be involved with one event [on the Tuesday](https://events.ringcentral.com/events/dataconnect-2024/registration)). Though I must say I’m disappointed that, unlike previous years, registration seems to be restricted to the public sector only - and that one of the opening events appears to be a manel.

### **Conference calls** {#conference-calls}
Party conference season is upon us, where party members, campaigners, lobbyists and journalists gather to hear speeches and panel discussions, debate motions (for some parties, and to varying degrees), and hope that a surfeit of beige buffet food will be sufficient to soak up all the free alcohol.

[SNP conference](https://www.snp.org/events/snp-90th-annual-national-conference-2024/) took place in Edinburgh over the weekend. Still to come:
* [Greens](https://greenparty.org.uk/get-involved/conference/), Manchester, 6-8 September (there’s a motion, [‘Addressing the Dire Need for AI Regulation’](https://www.greencoordinate.co.uk/motions/addressing-the-dire-need-for-ai-regulation/), which is likely to be heard)
* [Lib Dems](https://www.libdems.org.uk/conference), Brighton, 14-17 September
* [Reform](https://www.reformparty.uk/reform_uk_2024_national_conference), Birmingham, 20-21 September
* [Labour](https://labour.org.uk/annual-conference/), Liverpool, 22-25 September
* [Conservatives](https://www.conservatives.com/conference), Birmingham, 29 September to 2 October
* [Plaid Cymru](https://www.partyof.wales/conference), Cardiff, 11-12 October

Also, the [TUC Congress](https://www.tuc.org.uk/Congress2024) is happening in Brighton, 8-11 September, and there are [several motions on AI](https://congress.tuc.org.uk/motion_type/all_motions/#sthash.vRIRTqIH.dpbs) (scroll down to 73 to 76, for example).

Jeni, Adam and I will be in Liverpool for Labour conference - drop us a line if you’d like to meet. And we’re delighted that Connected by Data, with our friends at Careful Industries and the Minderoo Centre, with support from the Startup Coalition, Zoom.Info and the Open Data Institute, will be putting on a drinks reception, [‘Building tech for everyone’](https://www.sc-techhub.co.uk/labour-conference), 6-8pm on Sunday 22 September, at [Madre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S3HuMGhEL4AULxDd7) Mexican restaurant near the conference centre.  

We’ve also pulled together [a spreadsheet of data, tech and AI-related events at the different conferences](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbZlT1ColiwokPdVgaSXhtF5tyw8FBRehEyuAWlhXto/edit?usp=sharing). We’ll update it as more information becomes available - though feel free to add anything we’ve missed (or [drop us a line](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com)).


### **Parly-vous data?** {#parly-vous-data}
As we noted in the intro, Parliament returns today with the Commons debating [‘technology in public services’](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/88398/Html?subType=Standard#20240902-7). We’ve published [a short briefing](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/technology-in-public-services), and the [Commons Library also has a primer for the debate](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2024-0115/). The debate could start at any time from around 3.30pm and run until 10pm - though, given it’s the first day back, [expect there to be ministerial statements and urgent questions](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/88398/Html?subType=Standard) that could delay the start for a long while. The PM is listed as moving the motion, though in reality it may end up being another minister - they’ll then be followed by a Conservative shadow minister, contributions from other MPs (which may include relevant spokespeople from other parties and previous members of relevant select committees), and then a Conservative shadow minister and government minister to wrap up. Conference recess runs from 12 September to 7 October, and when parliament returns there are DSIT questions (Wednesday 16 October), DCMS questions (Thursday 17 October) and Cabinet Office questions (Thursday 24 October) to look forward to.

Some important Commons dates before then:
* Thursday 5 September, when the [Business Statement](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48654) will tell us what’s coming up…
* …and there’s [a ballot](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/88398/Html?subType=Standard#20240902-12) for which [Private Members’ Bills](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/publications/guides/private-members-bills-new) will go before the House. You can [watch the numbers being drawn from a bowl LIVE](https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/d1a7e246-e26e-4913-bba5-22939272a2c5), like it’s the lottery or a cup draw (h/t the excellent [Hansard Society newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/hansardsociety/whats-coming-up-in-parliament-this-week-9q5c6nbyk8?e=544ff52992))
* Monday 9 September, when nominations close for select committee chair elections. A Labour MP [will chair](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-07-30/debates/9976B64E-277F-4F7A-AAC1-51E385F57615/BusinessWithoutDebate) the Science, Innovation and Technology committee, while committees to be chaired by Tories include DCMS, PACAC and Public Accounts (they’re allocated based on the election result and discussions between whips)
* Wednesday 11 September, when MPs from all parties will vote for select committee chairs. [Chi Onwurah](https://x.com/ResFortnight/status/1818325382413595008) (previously a shadow DSIT minister) and [Dawn Butler](https://x.com/DawnButlerBrent/status/1821207667248959937) (previously a member of the SIT committee) are contesting the chair of Science, Innovation and Technology. Elections for select committee members will follow at some point - these are also allocated according to election results, but with only MPs from each party voting for their representatives (rather than the whole House).

In the Lords… 3 September: the Communications and Digital Committee has an evidence session on [Digital Competition](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21896/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/), and there’s [a debate on the first report from the Covid Inquiry](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48720) which had something to say about data… 5 September: there’s an oral question on the [Ability of current online safety legislation to regulate abuse, including racism, islamophobia, homophobia, and sectarianism, on social media platforms](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48764) from Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick (Lab) (there’s [a riot-related question the day before](https://whatson.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-04/) from Labour’s Lord Sikka)... 9 September: Lord Clement-Jones’ (Lib Dem) [Private Members’ Bill](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/july/lords-private-members-bills-ballot-2024/) on automated and algorithmic decision making in the public sector is expected to be introduced, and there’s a debate on [Improving the performance, independence and accountability of UK Regulators](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48732) following [a select committee report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/ldindreg/56/5602.htm)… and on 12 September: Lord Dubs (Lab) has an oral question on [‘False information through electronic media’](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48778).
