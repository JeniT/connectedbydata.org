Hello, and welcome to our eleventh Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. 

And Happy New Year! (If it’s not too late to wish you that.) After the data and AI policy carnival of chaos that was 2023, we have a much quieter year to look forward to.

Kidding, obviously. Just the odd controversial bit of data-related legislation, a government response to the AI White Paper, more AI Summits, continued AI development at breakneck speed, the unfolding of the Post Office Horizon scandal, the small matter of a general election being called at some point and goodness knows what else to keep us busy. The Digest will be with you all the way.

# Data policy developments

## Deeply DPDIB
Several Lords were a-leaping with anger at the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill when they [debated it at Second Reading](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-12-19/debates/2960AC9B-D86E-4EA1-8E4E-F3198BEE702F/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) on 19 December, the last sitting day before Christmas. We’ll have a proper summary soon (in the meantime, you can [catch up on my live-tweeting](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1737027214359576879), [Big Brother Watch’s summary thread](https://twitter.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1737172181434441858) or read coverage ranging from [The Big Issue](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/dwp-bank-accounts-digital-bill-house-of-lords/) to the [Church Times](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2024/5-january/news/uk/bishop-of-st-albans-voices-concerns-over-data-protection-bill)), but suffice to say their lordships were unhappy with many of the same things raised by civil society and in the Commons, including: late amendments including powers for DWP to access benefit claimants’ bank account data, changes to data rules around elections, relaxation of data protection requirements and weakening of rights, threats to data adequacy with the EU, changes to definitions of ‘personal data’ and ‘scientific research’, sweeping Henry VIII clauses investing powers in the secretary of state, and much more.

Labour looked forward to ‘a long and fruitful exchange with the Government over the coming months. This will be a Bill that challenges the Government’, while Lib Dem Lord Clement-Jones warned:

> ‘We want to amend a great many of the provisions of the Bill and we want to scrutinise many other aspects of it where the amendments came through at a very late stage. I am afraid the Government should expect this Bill to have a pretty rough passage’.

The next port of call in that passage, committee stage, is yet to be scheduled (we hear rumours of mid-February, once the Digital Markets Bill has made it through committee). But it will be a [‘Grand Committee’](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/grandcommittees/) - any member of the Lords is welcome to go along, but [any changes to the Bill have to be agreed unanimously](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62fe365fe90e0703e1bb4844/2022-08_Guide_to_Making_Legislation_-_master_version__4_.pdf#page=256), meaning most of the amendment action is likely to come through votes at Report Stage. [Some amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications) have gone down already (and there are some updates to the [supporting documentation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-and-digital-information-bill-impact-assessments#full-publication-update-history) too).

In other data protection and Bill-related developments:
* Some peers noted concern from the Information Commissioner about ICO was wary of the **new DWP powers** - he wrote [a letter to the Times](https://twitter.com/owenboswarva/status/1740355328129327374) (h/t Owen Boswarva), who also [published a story on it](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/27dataregulator-8m7t2rmg8) ([Computer Weekly have a non-paywalled report](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366565452/Information-Commissioner-questions-DWP-plan-to-monitor-bank-accounts-of-benefit-claimants))... while [Jen](https://twitter.com/TheABB) spotted [the impact assessment](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6564bab01524e6000da10168/DWP_third_party_data_impact_assessment_november_2023.pdf) on those powers (and some media outlets picked up on [the affected banks](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/dwp-issues-list-15-banks-28430656), the largest 15 in the UK)... and Public Technology reports that ‘[DWP signs deal for AI tech to analyse citizens’ social posts in anti-fraud drive](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/01/18/society-and-welfare/dwp-signs-deal-for-ai-tech-to-analyse-citizens-social-posts-in-anti-fraud-drive/)’ 

* **Smart data** is part of the Bill - the government has just launched a consultation on ‘[empowering drivers and boosting competition in the road fuel retail market](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/empowering-drivers-and-boosting-competition-in-the-road-fuel-retail-market)’ which mentions it, and there was some briefing about smart data in the energy sector to the Mail over Christmas ([‘“One-click” energy switch will let households change energy supplier in just seven days under plans considered by Ministers’](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12913583/One-click-energy-switch-let-households-change-energy-supplier-just-seven-days-plans-considered-Ministers.html))

* **And more broadly...** the ICO have launched a series of consultations with one on [generative AI and data protection](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/ico-and-stakeholder-consultations/ico-consultation-series-on-generative-ai-and-data-protection/) …  Google are rolling out [cookie-blocking within Chrome](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67882315) … and Gloria González Fuster has published an online [history of data protection](https://glgonzalezfuster.blog/history-of-data-protection-an-online-anthology/). 

## Bills, bills, bills
**Online Safety Act** [Many provisions came into force on 10 January](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1420/regulation/2/made), a day after a delegated legislation committee [debated the draft Online Safety (List of Overseas Regulators) Regulations 2024](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20187/formal-meeting/) … [Ofcom poaches Big Tech staff in push to enforce new internet curbs](https://www.ft.com/content/19e9da57-5da4-40bc-989d-9820bf3d2aff) ... there’s [a call for evidence as part of the government’s pornography review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pornography-review-asks-for-views-to-shape-industry-rules) … and there’s [a renewed push around online safety in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/02/children-safety-social-media-california/), taking inspiration from the UK approach…

## AI got ‘rithm
Some retrospectives: Rest of World have looked at [how AI shook the world in 2023](https://restofworld.org/2023/the-year-of-ai-boom-2023/), while Marci Harris looks at [how the US Congress used generative AI](https://twitter.com/marcidale/status/1737197709189431728) in 2023. Looking ahead, Politico’s Digital Bridge has [a preview of 2024](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/digital-bridge/your-digital-policy-guide-for-2024/), Ethan Mollick (the guy who generated that viral fake of himself) shares [some hints about the next year of AI](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/signs-and-portents), Stanford HAI asked its experts [what to expect on AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/what-expect-ai-2024) and The New PPT its experts about [international tech cooperation](https://thenewppt.substack.com/p/international-tech-cooperation-in).

Speaking of things we might expect in 2024… has-the-government-published- its-AIWhitePaper-responseyet.com

There had been rumours the government would publish the response to its AI White Paper consultation this week – perhaps because of Michelle Donelan’s speech (see below). It hasn’t. But the FT have been digging and say [there will be ‘tests’ on whether the government should publish new AI laws](https://www.ft.com/content/61630015-faaa-4f16-a8aa-67787f46fafe). “The economic stakes are so high in AI, and, without strong regulatory incentives, you can’t expect companies to stick to voluntary commitments once their market incentives move in a different direction,” Ada’s Michael Birtwistle told the FT.

The government is also [launching an ‘AI Opportunity Forum’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-hosts-final-meeting-of-2023-business-council-wednesday-20-december-2023), co-chaired by Franck Petitgas (the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Business and Investment) and Michelle Donelan to ‘explore in more detail the adoption of AI technologies across the private sector’.

The curtain still hasn’t come down on the EU AI Act drama with [debates over wording](https://twitter.com/montezumachavez/status/1747296273294602412). Meanwhile, one policymaking participant reminds us of the [human cost](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7147643915280535552/) of such situations… [’EU competition chief defends Artificial Intelligence Act after Macron’s attack’](https://www.ft.com/content/2b18b3e7-5b92-4577-9c8e-6db2bdd016d8) … [‘on AI, von der Leyen sees glass half full in Davos’](https://www.politico.eu/article/on-ai-ey-von-der-leyen-sees-glass-half-full-in-davos/) … and a leaked manifesto suggests the EU centre-right is [pushing back on red tape around AI](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/leak-eu-centre-right-targets-brussels-red-tape-says-ai-should-not-be-hindered/).

## DSIT up and take notice
As well as [a nice Christmas bit from the DSIT social media team](https://twitter.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1737367415032357264), the end of 2023 brought various round-ups of the year in government data and digital, including from Public Technology’s top stories, parts [one](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/12/28/government-and-politics/publictechnologys-biggest-stories-of-2023-part-one/) and [two](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/12/29/government-and-politics/publictechnologys-biggest-stories-of-2023-part-two) … Computer Weekly’s [top 10 government IT stories](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366563315/Top-10-government-IT-stories-of-2023) (and other compilations, including the [top AI regulation stories](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366563675/Top-10-AI-regulation-stories-of-2023))... Global Government Forum’s [top news stories](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/from-ai-fears-to-public-service-strikes-on-pay-global-government-forums-top-news-stories-of-2023), [webinars](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/from-ai-to-net-zero-revisit-ggfs-most-popular-webinars-of-2023) and [features](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/digital-transformation-and-maintaining-public-service-legitimacy-the-best-of-global-government-forums-2023-interviews-and-features) …

There were look-aheads from key government data and digital figures, with DSIT’s perm sec wanting the department to [allow ‘people to think big, take risk, and move fast’](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/12/27/education-and-skills/dsit-boss-wants-tech-department-to-allow-people-to-think-big-take-risk-and-move-fast/) ... the head of GDS’s [top priority being around One Login](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/01/02/society-and-welfare/gds-head-our-top-priority-for-2024-is-working-with-hmrc-to-migrate-millions-of-government-gateway-users-to-one-login/) … [the national statistician looking to 2031](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/01/08/education-and-skills/national-statistician-we-are-looking-at-whether-a-traditional-census-goes-ahead-in-2031/), and whether there’ll be a traditional census… [a range of leaders](https://www.government-transformation.com/transformation/the-top-priority-areas-for-ddat-leaders-in-2024) talking to Government Transformation Magazine about their priorities… the head of the National Audit Office [‘put(ting) digital and AI in the frame for ongoing modernisation’](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/01/04/education-and-skills/nao-chief-puts-digital-and-ai-in-the-frame-for-ongoing-modernisation/) ([he said similar to parliament this week](https://www.nao.org.uk/press-releases/improving-productivity-could-release-tens-of-billions-for-government-priorities/))... and some general trend-spotting from [Public Technology](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/12/27/government-and-politics/the-top-public-sector-tech-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2024/) and [UKAuthority](https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/five-things-for-public-sector-digital-in-2024/) …

And there were some [new year’s honours for tech people in government](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/government-commercial-chief-and-former-passport-office-head-named-in-new-years-honours) including the CDIO at DSIT and a Number 10 data scientist. OSB campaigner Ian Russell [was among](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-celebrates-service-to-others-in-hm-the-kings-new-year-honours) the others honoured.

[Michelle Donelan’s speech this week](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/science-innovation-and-technology-secretary-michelle-donelans-speech-at-plexal) didn’t launch the government’s AI White Paper response. But it did set out some of DSIT’s priorities for ‘scale ups’, including setting up a forum and new regulatory support service, backing [a new Regulatory Horizons Council report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-horizons-council-the-role-of-regulation-in-supporting-scaling-up) (they’ve published another on [moving from regulatory principles to practice too](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-horizons-council-closing-the-gap-series-overview), [UKRI have also published something](https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-declaration-supporting-businesses-to-grow-and-scale/supporting-businesses-to-grow-and-scale/)), and ‘making data access a government priority this year… whilst of course continuing to prioritise data privacy and data consent’ given the ‘potential goldmine’ of data central and local government holds.

There’s been lots on AI in government (just for a change)...

In other ministerial news, [Julia Lopez returns](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/julia-lopez) from maternity leave, replacing John Whittingdale (she’ll be responsible for DPDIB when it comes back to the Commons). And in other personnel news… AI Summit sherpa, [Jonathan Black](https://twitter.com/jonathanblackuk), is returning to government as deputy National Security Adviser… while [James Snook](https://twitter.com/JamesSno), former head of data policy at DSIT and DCMS, has joined Flint Global.

## Parly-vous data?
The first Wednesday back in the Commons saw [DSIT questions](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-10/debates/98C36C30-0662-40E9-AC76-91B86F5B1B86/OralAnswersToQuestions) and [an urgent question on the Post Office Horizon scandal](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-10/debates/3DDD9684-C08D-4E5E-AF73-CF85839412AB/PostOfficeHorizonScandal) as the bread in a PMQs sandwich. DCMS questions the following day also had one on [AI and the creative industries](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-11/debates/F45B9575-8B48-48D0-8FB0-D827D755CA08/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-777D744F-285F-4E3F-994E-CBDB3ACCE11F). Also in the Commons, the education committee quizzed experts on [‘how should children be taught about online harms and digital literacy?’](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20209) and the Public Accounts Committee covered [some data and digital issues](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20229/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) with civil service chief operating officer, Alex Chisholm (who steps down in a few months). There was also a Westminster Hall debate on [‘Online Filter Bubbles: Misinformation and Disinformation’](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-16/debates/9BA38505-4297-4CFC-A009-4A617BC682A9/OnlineFilterBubblesMisinformationAndDisinformation).

In the Lords, the DPDIB debate was preceded by [a question on confidential medical records and the NHS app](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-12-19/debates/23D33CF3-F92D-4C4D-ABC1-AD807EBC31EB/NHSAppMedicalRecords), and the Communications and Digital Committee has [published some new evidence for its LLMs inquiry](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7827/large-language-models/publications/), including from OpenAI (on [using copyrighted material](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai)) and DSIT (which touches on the controversy about whether the central risk function controversy, a saga regular readers have been gripped by).

## Labour movement
Keir Starmer made [a new year’s speech](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmers-new-year-speech/) which named technology as one of the big challenges of the age… the party has published [a single document bringing together its missions](https://labour.org.uk/missions/), and there are reports manifesto policies need to be [finalised in February](https://twitter.com/hoffman_noa/status/1737517857343193524) … one of the mission areas is education: shadow ed sec Bridget Phillipson [gave a speech](https://www.bridgetphillipson.com/speeches/2024/01/09/bridget-phillipson-speaks-at-the-centre-for-social-justice/) which touched on their children’s number pledge; Jen Persson has written more about [data in schools](https://jenpersson.com/school-absence-bums-in-seats-thinking-is-the-wrong-problem-and-ai-the-wrong-solution/) off the back of it, while medConfidential argue that [‘NHS numbers are for life, not just for children’](https://medconfidential.org/2024/nhs-numbers-are-for-life/) … the Welsh leadership contest is in full swing, with opening pitches from [Jeremy Miles](https://labourlist.org/2024/01/read-full-text-of-jeremy-miles-vision-for-wales-speech/) and [Vaughan Gething](https://labourlist.org/2024/01/vaughan-gething-campaign-speech-a-first-black-european-leader-would-show-we-can-all-realise-our-potential/) not having a huge amount to say on data, tech or AI…

Politico ([paywall](https://pro.politico.eu/news/173609)) reports shadow DSIT secretary, Peter Kyle’s, new advisers will start soon (and that he’s accused the government of inconsistency in tech policy, and has been meeting techUK members)... Kyle also talked about [data centres and planning reform](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001tsdj) (47 minute mark) - [Google yesterday announced it's investing in a new data centre in Hertfordshire](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/google-1-billion-investment-in-a-new-uk-data-centre/) … there ‘s been some briefing about putting [tech at the centre of public service reform](https://twitter.com/agstrait/status/1742849780273823894) … and some Labour research on [the scale of government legacy IT systems at 'critical' risk](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/scale-of-legacy-it-systems-at-critical-risk-revealed). 

## On the Horizon
One tech story has dominated the news over the last few weeks, with the Post Office Horizon scandal (finally) breaking through into wider public consciousness thanks to an ITV drama, [Mr Bates vs the Post Office](https://www.itv.com/watch/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/10a0469/10a0469a0001). There’s plenty out there - Computer Weekly (one of the key outlets in reporting the story) have an ‘[everything you need to know](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Post-Office-Horizon-scandal-explained-everything-you-need-to-know)’ piece; the BBC have made their vital [Panorama](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0016t20) of a few years ago available; and I can heartily recommend Nick Wallis’ book on the scandal - [his website](https://www.postofficescandal.uk/) also has links to Private Eye and other reporting.

Some pieces we’ve seen floating around our networks… [a set of lessons from IfG](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/comment/lessons-government-post-office-scandal) which includes a few paragraphs from me on the tech/human angle… [mySociety have a summary](https://mailchi.mp/mysociety.org/people-power-vs-the-post-office?e=c20ae2c68f), including the importance of FoI in bringing facts to light… Peter Wells wrote a few months ago about [the computer evidence angle](https://peterkwells.com/2023/10/), also the subject of work by [City University](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/23930/), [James Christie](https://clarotesting.wordpress.com/2023/10/19/the-law-commission-and-the-presumption-that-computer-evidence-is-reliable/) and [David Allen Green](https://davidallengreen.com/2024/01/how-the-legal-system-made-it-so-easy-for-the-post-office-to-destroy-the-lives-of-the-sub-postmasters-and-sub-postmistresses-and-how-the-legal-system-then-made-it-so-hard-for-them-to-obtain-justice/) … the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/3cbb7be5-d1ee-4676-8327-f120a4782135) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-10/britain-s-post-office-scandal-highlights-the-scourge-of-bad-management-in-ai-a) reflect on the role of tech… the Open Government Network’s Kevin Ketih took [an open government angle](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/cabinet-office-more-government-whitehall-cabinet-b2476472.html) with The Independent… former head of the Government Digital Service, [Mike Bracken](https://public.digital/2024/01/12/avoiding-another-horizon), and former Blair adviser, [Geoff Mulgan](https://www.geoffmulgan.com/post/scandal-at-the-post-office) (you may have seen his prescient 1999 memo doing the rounds) shared their perspectives… while the Royal Statistical Society reminded us of another tech system-driven scandal, [Robodebt in Australia](https://academic.oup.com/jrssig/article/20/6/18/7457250?login=false), and [‘DWP boss “really hopes” fraud-busting IT scheme doesn’t echo Horizon scandal’](https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/dwp-boss-really-hopes-fraud-busting-it-scheme-doesnt-echo-horizon-scandal/), reports the Disability News Service.

# What we’ve been up to
* We’ve been planning an event! On 13 February, we’re holding an online event, ['Datafied': How data and AI policy will impact all areas of progressive action, and what civil society can do about it?](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-02-13-cso-workshop) This is a free virtual workshop for civil society and campaigners to get to grips with how data and AI affects your areas, whether that’s education, health, benefits, housing, social care, work, policing, democratic engagement or a multitude of other areas. The session will give an accessible introduction to those with a general level of knowledge of the issues, focusing on how current data driven and AI systems affect people and relevant policy areas, provide an opportunity to discuss campaigning approaches on those issues, and take a practical look at the new data legislation going through Parliament and how data and AI policy issues are likely to feature in the coming General Election. Come, and please do spread the word to your networks!
