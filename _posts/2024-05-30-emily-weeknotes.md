### What I’ve been doing
* It’s been a tough week.  I was off for a couple of days (on top of the Bank Holiday) and when I got back to work discovered I’d let a biggish ball drop - it hadn’t quite smashed but it was far from great (and I find that kind of failure, that really shouldn’t have happened, hard to swallow).
* Today though I’ve been really productive and cleared a lot of things that had built up over those few days and some stuff from last week too.
* We had a really good ‘end of year accounts’ chat with our new accountant today too.  Some refinements to do there but close to getting those signed off which will be great for lots of reasons.
* At the end of last week I fell down a “when is an honorarium a work payment?” hole.  That was…an experience.

### What I need to take care of
* Next week I’m speaking, on behalf of **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** at the [Libraries Connected Annual Seminar](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-05-libraries-connected-annual-seminar) on a Panel about ‘AI and information literacy’.  This isn’t usually my realm but the combination of libraries and this work (and the support of the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** team) means I’m there for it, and really looking forward to it!
* I’ve got a couple of launch event/webinars to attend next week also about projects that align with our values and may have funding opportunities attached.
* We’ve also got our first [Data and AI Policy Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) meeting since the General Election was called.  I’m looking forward to hearing everyone considering their next steps / priorities and opportunities for collaboration / sharing voices.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
[This video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ck0IwGlqSFJ/) (I’ve been storing it for a while).  Wow.  Such a powerful video on so many levels and (if we need it, which we shouldn’t) an effortless reminder of why we need to ensure we hear the voices of those directly impacted upon by decisions, actions / inactions.

### What I’ve been reading
I’m still in Act of Oblivion by Robert Harris. Still engaged by it. It is long but wow I’m a slow reader now (or more accurately a sporadic reader).
