Hello, and welcome to our ninth Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments.  We have a wrap up of the AI Summit - and [fully endorse this sentiment](https://twitter.com/techUKdepCEO/status/1720407325339521194) - but there’s also a lot about to happen, Bills-wise.

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**.

# Data policy developments

## Deeply DPDIB
[The King’s Speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-kings-speech-2023) (the first [since 2010](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504320/) … sorry, since 1951) outlined the legislative agenda for the remainder of this parliament (drama aside, this is likely to be the last session before the general election, which must happen by the end of January 2025). 

[The Data Protection and Digital Information (No 2) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430) was one of those ‘carried over’ from the previous session, but it’s now known simply as the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (not to be confused with [the previous abandoned Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3322) of that name). And… 

WE HAVE A DATE: it’ll [return to the Commons](https://whatson.parliament.uk/commons/2023-11-29/) for report stage on Wednesday 29 November. 

[The background notes to the Speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-kings-speech-2023-background-briefing-notes) say the quiet part out loud: DPDIB ‘has been co-designed with industry, for industry, in order to maximise the economic benefits’, with little thought for the impact on the public. No wonder [our friends at ORG](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaign/hands-off-our-data/) are dubbing it the ‘Data Grab Bill’: ‘your data will be used against you and you’ll have less ability to do anything about it’. We’ll continue to follow the Bill - [check out our resources for more](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources).

In addition… Chris Pounder has written about how [DPDI No 2 Bill undermines transparency of Artificial Intelligence development and training](https://amberhawk.typepad.com/amberhawk/2023/10/dpdi-no-2-bill-undermines-transparency-of-artificial-intelligence-development-and-training.html) … and a statutory instrument making some changes to data protection legislation (that [we wrote about last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/10/27/data-policy-digest)) *will* need to be agreed by parliament - [let David Erdos be your guide](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4610305). 

## Bills, bills, bills
**Online Safety Act** Ofcom has [published several draft codes of practice](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2023/tech-firms-must-clamp-down-on-illegal-online-materials) … there’s a [new Online Safety Act Network](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/welcome-to-the-online-safety-act-network/) led by Maeve Walsh and Professor Lorna Woods… the government [published a ‘raft of voices’ in support](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/overwhelming-support-for-online-safety-act-as-rules-making-uk-the-safest-place-in-the-world-to-be-online-become-law) of the Act.

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** It’s [Commons report stage](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages) on 20 November before it heads to the Lords… and after weeks of speculation, [the government is amending it](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-digital-markets-bill-introduced-to-ensure-fairer-competition-in-tech-industry) - Politico’s take is [‘Rishi Sunak performs delicate balancing act in Big Tech lobbying battle’](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-uk-performs-balancing-act-in-tech-lobbying-battle/), caving in to some but not all of big tech’s asks.

**Other** [Another Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508) - [the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/investigatory-powers-amendment-bill) - will have [consequences for data](https://twitter.com/smithsam/status/1722367644026765408) … there was criticism of the lack of AI regulation in the King’s Speech [from the Science, Innovation and Technology select committee and others](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-innovation-and-technology-committee/news/198315/lack-of-aispecific-legislation-in-kings-speech-risks-uk-ambitions/) … and campaigners also think it [missed the mark on cyber reform](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366558652/Kings-Speech-misses-the-mark-on-cyber-law-reform-says-campaign) … DSIT published [a summary of the science and tech announcements](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/science-and-technology-in-the-kings-speech-2023) (with some unfortunate typos), which also includes a legal framework on machine learning and (oddly not mentioned in that link) [an Automated Vehicles Bill](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/654a21952f045e001214dcd7/The_King_s_Speech_background_briefing_notes.pdf#page=21).

# AI got ‘rithm
Apparently there was some international AI Safety Summit the other week.

Connected by Data worked with [ORG](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/letter-to-rishi-sunak-ai-summit/) and the [TUC](https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/ai-summit-dominated-big-tech-and-missed-opportunity-civil-society-organisations-tell-prime) to coordinate [a huge open letter](https://ai-summit-open-letter.info/) of more than 100 signatories calling for the voices of communities, civil society and workers to be included. [Covered initially by the FT](https://www.ft.com/content/07669dbf-a2b5-4472-943f-6ee1ba5a8336), it was great to see the letter - and its arguments, made by many across civil society and other sectors - across lots of Summit media coverage.

Our other big initiative was [the People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai). This brought together 11 representative members of the public to attend, observe and discuss key events at the AI Fringe, and they ended the week by [coming up with seven recommendations](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/11/03/peoples-panel-bulletin-5).

We’ve got more links on the Summit than you could shake a Large Language Model at in **a special section (AI-nnex?) at the end of this newsletter**. That covers various scene-setting pieces, all the events we could find on film or transcript, official documents, and reactions, further coverage and much more besides. 

So we’ll just concentrate on the key announcements up here. 

BEFORE THE SUMMIT:
* [New £100 million fund to capitalise on AI’s game-changing potential in life sciences and healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-100-million-fund-to-capitalise-on-ais-game-changing-potential-in-life-sciences-and-healthcare) ([from the PM’s speech on 26 October](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023))

* [UK unites with global partners to accelerate development using AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-unites-with-global-partners-to-accelerate-development-using-ai): ‘with Canada, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the USA and partners in Africa, the UK is helping to fund a £80 million ($100 million) boost in AI programming to combat inequality and boost prosperity on the continent’.

THURSDAY: 
* [World leaders, top AI companies set out plan for safety testing of frontier as first global AI Safety Summit concludes](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leaders-top-ai-companies-set-out-plan-for-safety-testing-of-frontier-as-first-global-ai-safety-summit-concludes): this heralded a plan on AI Safety testing, [a ‘State of the Science’ report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-chairs-statement-state-of-the-science-2-november) led by Yoshua Bengio, and future AI Safety Summits in six months (Korea, virtual) and a year (France, in person)

* [Prime Minister launches new AI Safety Institute](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-launches-new-ai-safety-institute): this confirmed the evolution of the Frontier AI Taskforce into the Institute, and agreements with the US AI Safety Institute (announced earlier in the week) and the Government of Singapore. The government published [a more extensive overview of the Institute](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-institute-overview), too, and the current taskforce published its [second progress report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-taskforce-second-progress-report/frontier-ai-taskforce-second-progress-report).

FROM THE US:
* President Biden issued a pretty comprehensive [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence ([factsheet summary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/), [AI.gov is looking for talent](https://ai.gov/), [summary of various AI announcements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/01/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-u-s-initiatives-to-advance-the-safe-and-responsible-use-of-artificial-intelligence/), welcomed by [one of those involved with the AI Bill of Rights](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement-caps-alondra-nelson-praises-executive-order-on-artificial-intelligence/))

* Vice President Kamala Harris gave a major speech in London ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PKfIis1rqU), [transcript](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-london-united-kingdom/)) - Politico’s take was [‘Existential to who?’ US VP Kamala Harris urges focus on near-term AI risks](https://www.politico.eu/article/existential-to-who-us-vp-kamala-harris-urges-focus-on-near-term-ai-risks/), noting that ‘Harris’ remarks echo similar concerns from civil society groups’

* There’s also a [Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy](https://www.state.gov/political-declaration-on-responsible-military-use-of-artificial-intelligence-and-autonomy-3/) (the US, the UK and others have signed).

Now let us never speak of it again. 

(Until South Korea’s virtual summit in six months’ time. And the French one in a year. And AI all day every day until the end of time. Maybe the killer robots would be welcome after all.)

**NON-SUMMIT AI** The LSE noted children weren’t mentioned at the summit, but have published [AI and children’s rights: a guide to the transnational guidance](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2023/11/01/ai-and-childrens-rights-a-guide-to-the-transnational-guidance/) … though the education secretary [tweeted about how DfE is using AI](https://twitter.com/GillianKeegan/status/1718932510111838269) ‘to reform education for the better’… [DfE updated its generative AI guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education) to include privacy and intellectual property concerns… '[Most of our friends use AI in schoolwork](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-67236732)' (BBC Young Reporters)… and [not everyone is impressed](https://twitter.com/RealGeoffBarton/status/1718896142174601282) with £2m going to Oak National Academy on AI…

# DSIT up and take notice
In a previous life, [this was me](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/live-blog/reshuffle-november-2023) trying to chart all the ministerial changes as a government reshuffle unfolded. I am therefore very grateful to be able to focus on only the data/tech changes… At DSIT: [George Freeman stepped down](https://twitter.com/GeorgeFreemanMP/status/1724072623619907929) as science minister, replaced by [Andrew Griffith](https://twitter.com/griffitha/status/1724171513144754500) (MP since 2019, ex-Sky, former head of Boris Johnson’s policy unit); while [Paul Scully was sacked](https://twitter.com/scullyp/status/1724165545203753172) as tech and digital economy minister ([El Bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Archer), if you’re wondering), replaced by [Saqib Bhatti](https://twitter.com/bhatti_saqib/status/1724397906491289897) (MP since 2019, accountant by background, former vice chair of the Tory Party). (Not forgetting that a few weeks ago, the department’s parliamentary private secretary - a junior aide - [was sacked](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-conservative-mp-paul-bristow-sacked-from-government-post-after-calling-for-gaza-ceasefire-12996701) over his stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict.)

Elsewhere, [John Glen](https://twitter.com/JohnGlenUK/status/1724099922406912290) became the 13th Minister for the Cabinet Office (responsible for data in government) in 13 years - just as [a review of civil service governance and accountability](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-governance-and-accountability) from one of his predecessors, Francis Maude (2010-15, a whole FIVE YEARS), was published. It includes recommendations on the better use of data, and that the Government Digital Service and Central Digital and Data Office be ‘unified as a single team’. It came shortly after the most senior civil servant in the department and COO for the civil service, Alex Chisholm, announced he’d be [stepping down](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/alex-chisholm-to-leave-cabinet-office-in-the-spring) next year.

The new Home Secretary, James Cleverly, had taken an interest in AI while at the Foreign Office - including [discussing the dangers](https://twitter.com/JamesCleverly/status/1720335352940949970). 

AS for what DSIT has actually been up to… secretary of state Michelle Donelan is [in the US](https://twitter.com/michelledonelan/status/1724436995433226387), where engagements included a [speech to the Family Online Safety Institute](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/secretary-of-state-speech-to-fosi-annual-conference) and [a trip to the National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://twitter.com/michelledonelan/status/1724835011008848380) … Politico have [done a profile of her](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-tech-michelle-donelan-from-wwe-to-ai-safety-summit-rise-sunak/) … while she’s [one of many ministers with disappearing WhatsApp messages](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-british-governments-disappearing-whatsapps/) …

[George Freeman hosted a reception](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-visit-of-the-secretary-general-of-asean-to-the-uk-november-2023-joint-summary) for the Secretary General of ASEAN, Dr Kao Kim Hourn, [celebrating ASEAN-UK cooperation on science](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/boost-to-asean-uk-cooperation-with-first-uk-visit-by-asean-secretary-general) … ‘[Philanthropic partnership unlocks £32 million for the future of best-in-class UK Biobank](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/philanthropic-partnership-unlocks-32-million-for-the-future-of-best-in-class-uk-biobank)’, though the Observer [reported they shared data with insurance companies](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/12/private-uk-health-data-donated-medical-research-shared-insurance-companies) ([UK Biobank has called the report ‘highly misleading’](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/news/response-to-highly-misleading-article-in-the-observer))… there was [a quantum showcase](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-technologies-on-show-at-quantum-showcase-as-science-minister-drives-forward-uks-25-billion-quantum-strategy) and agreements with [the Netherlands](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-netherlands-cooperation-in-quantum-science-and-technologies-memorandum-of-understanding) and [Australia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-australia-cooperation-in-quantum-science-and-technologies-joint-statement) …  there’s a big job going at DSIT, as [Director of Data Policy](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1884552), which you have until close of play this Sunday to apply for… the department published [July minutes from the Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-commission-board-of-commissioners-meeting-11-july-2023) as it announced some [webinars on the National Underground Asset Register](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-underground-asset-register-nuar#getting-involved) … published [research on perceptions of digital subjects and careers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-skills-and-careers-behavioural-insights-study-2023) … and the Government Office for Technology Transfer has funded the National Physical Laboratory’s development of an [innovative new thermal imaging technology for foot ulcers](https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/new-use-of-thermal-imaging-could-reduce-diabetic-foot-amputations). (You really do get everything with this newsletter.) 

Deputy PM, Oliver Dowden, also gave an interview to the Times where he mentioned [AI could reduce ministers’ workload](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oliver-dowden-ai-could-reduce-ministers-workload-5st8sjmcd), and Viscount Camrose appeared at [the FT’s AI summit](https://ai.live.ft.com/agenda?dates=1700092800000) ([another one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-IQAdFU3w)).

# Parly-vous data?
There were [DSIT questions in the Commons yesterday](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-11-15/debates/6648F8BE-129B-44C5-B83F-FB622A6103DD/OralAnswersToQuestions), while [some of those down for DCMS today](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/82853/Html?subType=Standard#_idTextAnchor001) ask about AI. There’s also [a written ministerial statement](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/82853/Html?subType=Standard#20231116-22) coming on ‘Online Safety Act - Super-Complaints Consultation’.  As mentioned above, there was also [a Commons statement and debate on the AI Safety Summit](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-11-09/debates/D73007F1-646E-471F-A47A-248B4204DB49/ArtificialIntelligenceSafetySummit). The Commons Science, Innovation and Technology committee’s inquiry into AI governance continued, with Matt Clifford and senior DSIT official Emran Mian [giving evidence](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/19671/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) - and the government’s response to [the committee’s interim report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/1769/summary.html) is overdue. PACAC also took evidence on the use of, well, [evidence](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/19644/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) last week.

In the Lords, [one of the King’s Speech debates focused on science and tech](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-11-14/debates/B1CB0CFD-075F-4443-A4BD-CF234B68DA41/King%E2%80%99SSpeech), introduced by Viscount Camrose (Tim Clement-Jones on DPDIB is particularly worth a read - Labour’s Maggie Jones didn’t mention it).

# Labour movement
On top of Peter Kyle’s contributions to the debate around the AI Summit (see section below, as if you could have missed it)... there were stories about [Labour vowing to force firms developing powerful AI to meet requirements](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-labour-government-prime-minister-bletchley-park-b2440275.html) and [mulling a ‘robot tax’ to penalise firms replacing staff with AI](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/11/04/labour-technology-minister-robot-tax-companies-ai/), as shadow Lords minister [Steve Bassam told the House](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-11-14/debates/5236E6F1-F56A-4A2F-9DCF-A53CAEEDD57B/ArtificialIntelligenceRegulation) that any Labour government would ‘act swiftly’ on AI regulation.

Labour also [announced a ‘Regulatory Innovation Office’](https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1718608817661812815) to hold regulators accountable for delays on decisions about new products and services, [noting the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had a backlog of 966 clinical trial applications](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/labour-will-end-regulatory-backlogs-to-give-the-public-access-to-life-saving-treatments-sooner/) earlier this year which could lead to patients missing out on new life-saving medical treatments.
