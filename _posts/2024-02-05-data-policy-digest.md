# **Data policy developments**

## **Deeply DPDIB**

Like a lovelorn valentine, we’re looking for a date. Specifically, when the Bill will start Grand Committee stage in the Lords (more on what that means [in our last edition](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/01/19/data-policy-digest)). We’ve heard rumours of 21 or 26 February. 

In the meantime, get yourself up to speed with [our summary of Lords Second Reading](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-lords-2nd-reading-summary) - the first opportunity for peers to debate the Bill (tl;dr: they’re not happy with a lot of it and think it needs a lot of work). [The whole debate is in Hansard](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-12-19/debates/2960AC9B-D86E-4EA1-8E4E-F3198BEE702F/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) for the real nerds (which, let’s face it, you are one of if you’re reading this). 

A lack of dates does not mean a lack of activity… Lords have started [laying amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications)… the Lords Constitution Committee has published a report with concerns at [far-reaching powers, lack of scrutiny and lack of explanation](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/43076/documents/214262/default/)… the government has already backtracked on its backtracking on its promise to bereaved families around coroner access to data (BBC: [Bereaved parents win online harm battle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68184454))… interesting to see briefing around the [police time](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988065/More-365-000-hours-police-time-wasted-year-EU-rules-forcing-officers-remove-personal-details-files.html) ‘wasted’ owing to ‘EU rules’ in the Mail… digital service assessments from 2022 have just been published for the National Underground Asset Register, recently added to the Bill (it [failed](https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/national-underground-asset-register-alpha-assessment), then [met](https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/national-underground-asset-register-alpha-reassessment), its alpha stage)... [How much extra spam will the UK’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill create?](https://peterkwells.com/2024/01/19/how-much-extra-spam-will-the-uks-data-protection-and-digital-information-bill-create/) asks Peter Wells…

Tens of thousands of people have signed Big Brother Watch’s [petition against DWP bank snooping powers](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/dwp-spy-bank-accounts-benefit-claims-petition/), says the Big Issue… those powers ‘would [treat disabled people like criminals](https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/new-dwp-bank-snooping-powers-would-treat-disabled-people-like-criminals/) and further destroy trust’, campaigners told the Disability News Service… and a reminder that another controversial set of amendments, on ‘democratic engagement’, fits into [a broader set of worrying electoral rule changes](https://twitter.com/LOS_Fisher/status/1749551164193141043?t=stPULJtou1EBXUZL3-TnLg&s=03)…

And… the former Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner once again took the opportunity to [criticise the Bill](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65ae468c82fee9000d6f5fc5/E03010052_BSCC+ARA+22-23_Accessible.pdf) (and government’s [lack of engagement](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/01/31/public-order-justice-and-rights/surveillance-watchdog-laments-lack-of-interest-from-departments/), and [the Home Office](https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/former-commissioner-criticises-home-office-on-biometrics/)), as a missed opportunity and the abolition of his (former) office a mistake. He also reveals the original expectation was that the Bill receiving royal assent in March 2023.


## **Bills, bills, bills**

**Online Safety Act** The BBC’s [‘Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001w2s8/sunday-with-laura-kuenssberg-how-can-we-protect-our-children-online) had a strong [focus on online safety](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68193103)_ _with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey and other guests including education secretary Gillian Keegan, and shadow DSIT secretary, Peter Kyle… Politico has a [short summary](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/sunday-crunch/keegan-risks-the-wrath-of-the-right/)… [Banning children from social media would be short-sighted](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/banning-children-social-media-shortsighted), Baroness Kidron wrote last week for PoliticsHome…

Parts of the Online Safety Act have come into effect - ‘Cyberflashing, epilepsy-trolling and fake news to put online abusers behind bars’, [notes DSIT](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cyberflashing-epilepsy-trolling-and-fake-news-to-put-online-abusers-behind-bars-from-today)… a [list of overseas regulators](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=136097&sectionId=40&businessPaperDate=2024-01-22) has been laid in the Lords… Meta whistleblower Arturo Béjar has been in London, saying [regulators are the ‘last hope’](https://www.politico.eu/article/meta-whistleblower-regulators-are-our-last-hope-at-fixing-social-media/) for fixing social media (a Guardian leader also [picked up on his visit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/28/the-guardian-view-on-online-child-protection-the-web-needs-more-health-and-safety))... while Mark Zuckerberg and others were [in front of Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/31/tiktok-meta-x-congress-hearing-child-sexual-exploitation). 

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** The Bill is [making its way through Lords committee](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages/18121), with a couple more hearings this week… their Lordships are [not happy about Secretary of State powers](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-01-29/debates/677ECCC2-581D-458D-A334-436C4C9D5565/DigitalMarketsCompetitionAndConsumersBill#contribution-B0F80A58-2458-4966-BC5E-6A6B20CA8445) here, either. 

**Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill** We [await a date](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508/stages) for Commons Second Reading (this one has already been through the Lords)... Big Brother Watch, ORG, Rights and Security International, Liberty, Internet Society, and Privacy International have published [a critical  joint briefing](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/app/uploads/2024/01/Joint-Report-Stage-IPA-Bill-brief.pdf)… while [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/resource/the-investigatory-powers-amendment-bill-further-changes-are-still-needed-to-ensure-user-trust-and-safety-and-to-mitigate-potential-conflicts-of-law.html) and [Apple](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68128177) are among others with concerns.

**Other bills** Lord Bach has laid an amendment to the Victims and Prisoners Bill about [a consistent victim identifier](https://twitter.com/NatalieByrom/status/1754215683779448843).


## **AI got ‘rithm**

More looking for dates - in this case, the much-delayed government response to its AI White Paper. Politico thinks it could be Tuesday - i.e. TOMORROW - the same day DSIT secretary Michelle Donelan is in front of [a Lords select committee on generative AI and digital exclusion](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20561/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/). [Politico](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-governments-code-of-practice-on-copyright-and-ai) and [the FT](https://www.ft.com/content/a10866ec-130d-40a3-b62a-978f1202129e) hear that plans for a voluntary code on the issue of copyright and AI, which the Intellectual Property Office had been leading on, [have been dropped](https://twitter.com/JoeBambridge1/status/1752746025394045287); that [‘targeted, binding measures](https://pro.politico.eu/news/dsits-birthday-bash-brings-ai-quantum-chips) will be needed for the most advanced “highly-capable general purpose models” (aka foundation models)… eventually’; and to look out for ‘a new steering committee to monitor and formalize coordination across regulators, updates on DSIT’s “central function”’ and consultations on a risk register and [other parts of the regulatory system](https://twitter.com/vmanancourt/status/1754431448713507251).

Over in the EU… [political agreement being reached](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai) on the AI Act in December didn’t stop [controversy](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-innovation-shush-ai-act-critics/) [rumbling](https://twitter.com/BertuzLuca/status/1749326217612820558) on through January. (The Ada Lovelace Institute [urged approval](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/press-release/statement-on-the-eu-ai-act/) and EDRI published some [useful background](https://edri.org/our-work/council-to-vote-on-eu-ai-act-whats-at-stake/).) Member states [reached](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eu-countries-give-crucial-nod-to-first-of-a-kind-artificial-intelligence-law/) [agreement](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-countries-strike-deal-ai-law-act-technology/) on 2 February. The Commission has also issued a decision [establishing the European AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/commission-decision-establishing-european-ai-office). 

And… Margrethe Vestager, European Commission Executive Vice President and ‘top tech regulator’ [spoke to the Politico podcast](https://politico-tech.simplecast.com/episodes/one-on-one-with-the-eus-chief-tech-regulator)… while Italy told OpenAI that [ChatGPT violated European privacy laws](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-data-privacy-italy-a6ff88b53ae611ca4dee917e872ac278).

Lots of discussion of democracy, deepfakes and data… there’s a new book out on [data-driven campaigning](https://constitution-unit.com/2024/01/22/data-driven-campaigning-the-shape-and-perils-of-the-modern-election-campaign/)… the FT reported that [‘Audio deepfakes emerge as weapon of choice in election disinformation’](https://www.ft.com/content/bd75b678-044f-409e-b987-8704d6a704ea)... Tortoise published some views on [how to avoid an AI disaster at the next UK election](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2024/01/31/how-to-avoid-an-ai-disaster-at-the-next-uk-election/)… and MPs [‘call for action on deepfakes as fears grow among MPs over election threat’](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/call-for-action-on-deepfakes-as-fears-grow-among-mps-over-election-threat)... and…

More deepfakes (Taylor’s version). AI-generated explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift brought the issue to the fore… [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/taylor-swift-nude-deepfake-goes-viral-x-platform-rules-rcna135669?s=03) and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-ai-fake-images.html) have summaries of the story which led to X/Twitter [blocking the images](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68123671)… as does [a Twitter account that pretended to be a cybersecurity-interested Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1751401530601677235), because we live in the future, or something… [‘It’s men telling a powerful woman to get back in her box’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/31/inside-the-taylor-swift-deepfake-scandal-its-men-telling-a-powerful-woman-to-get-back-in-her-box), notes the Guardian in their exploration of the scandal… Platformer see the affair as [a warning](https://www.platformer.news/taylor-swift-deepfake-nudes-x/), while [Control AI polling](https://controlai.com/deepfakes) found a lot of support for banning deepfakes… in general, outlets questioned the Blank Space where regulation should be and wondered how deepfake victims without a large fandom and international profile would Shake It Off… as an Australian politician also found herself at the centre of a [doctored image scandal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68137013)…

## **DSIT up and take notice**

Happy first birthday to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, established on 7 February 2023. 

Over the past few weeks, the department has announced that the ‘State of the Science’ report (revealed at the AI Safety Summit) will be renamed the [International Scientific Report on Advanced AI Safety](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-expertise-to-drive-international-ai-safety-report), and unveiled an international advisory board for it (first edition [expected this spring](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-advanced-ai-safety-expert-advisory-panel-and-principles-and-procedures))...

As mentioned above, DSIT secretary Michelle Donelan (and Emran Mian, Director General for Digital Technologies and Telecoms) will appear in front of the Lords Communications and Digital Committee [on generative AI and digital exclusion](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20561/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/). 

The committee has been keeping *very* busy… [‘UK will miss AI goldrush unless Government adopts a more positive vision’](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7827/large-language-models/news/199728/uk-will-miss-ai-goldrush-unless-government-adopts-a-more-positive-vision/) was the main headline from their new report into LLMs. ‘The Committee considered the risks around LLMs and says the apocalyptic concerns about threats to human existence are exaggerated and must not distract policy makers from responding to more immediate issues’... they’re also accepting evidence on [‘The future of news: impartiality, trust and technology’](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8163/the-future-of-news-impartiality-trust-and-technology/) (again with a heavy AI element) until 12 February… on 8 February there’ll be a Lords [debate on their report on digital exclusion](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=132969&sectionId=38&businessPaperDate=2024-02-08)… and they’ve had [some changes to their membership](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=136224&sectionId=40&businessPaperDate=2024-01-24), as did the [Science and Technology](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=136241&sectionId=40&businessPaperDate=2024-01-24) committee…

Sticking with the Lords, the Justice and Home Affairs Committee has [written to the Home Secretary](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/519/justice-and-home-affairs-committee/news/199624/lords-committee-questions-legality-of-live-facial-recognition-technology/) questioning the legality of facial recognition technology… there was [a question on innovation and regulation](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-01-22/debates/3E0A63C5-266F-4281-AE4D-FB56CA2BB6AB/Debate)… and there are forthcoming questions on what steps the government is taking to protect[ freedom of expression in the course of their work on combating disinformation](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=136066&sectionId=38&businessPaperDate=2024-02-13) (Lord Strasburger, Lib Dem - something Big Brother Watch have [done plenty of work on](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/campaigns/ministry-of-truth/))... and what action they are taking to reform the Computer Misuse Act 1990 to [enable legitimate independent testing of computer systems](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=135979&sectionId=38&businessPaperDate=2024-02-12) (Lord Clement-Jones, Lib Dem).

It’s quieter in the Commons, though the Culture, Media and Sport select committee [touched on the impacts of AI](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/19951) as part of their inquiry into ‘the current state of the UK’s Film and High-End TV industries’... there was [an adjournment debate](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/debates/adjournment/) on [AI scams and consumer protection](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-22/debates/7D5CB585-963A-426A-9168-3A222F27A821/AIScamsConsumerProtection), and [a Westminster Hall debate](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/debates/westminster-hall-debates/) on [real time bus information in the north east](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-31/debates/9C049314-C502-4CF8-A071-120701F69989/Real-TimeBusInformationNorth-East)… and there will be question times in the House for DSIT ministers on Wednesday 21 February (and Wednesday 17 April), and for Cabinet Office ministers on Thursday 29 February (and Thursday 25 April).


## **Labour movement**

Lots of news about Labour’s manifesto as an apparent drafting deadline of 8 February hives into view. [‘Labour ditches radical reforms as it prepares ‘bombproof’ election manifesto’](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/03/labour-ditches-radical-reforms-as-it-prepares-bombproof-election-manifesto), is The Observer’s take. There’s no explicit mention there of tech policy, but the new deal for working people mentioned does include [a right to switch off](https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/a-new-deal-for-working-people/) and (from 2022) some more detailed thoughts on [collective bargaining and the use of tech](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Deal-for-Working-People-Green-Paper.pdf) in the workplace. Manifesto plans will be [vetted by various key figures](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/uk-needs-ambitious-green-plan-keep-up-allies-labour-frontbencher), including Jonathan Ashworth (shadow Cabinet Office) to see how proposals will withstand attacks, and Lucy Powell (shadow leader of the Commons, and former shadow DCMS) to see if they’ll make coherent legislation.

[Technology got a shout out](https://labourlist.org/2024/02/keir-starmer-speech-watch-read-labour-business-conference/) in Keir Starmer’s big speech to business leaders. Labour’s plan for financial services also talks about [setting international standards](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Financing-Growth.pdf#page=18) for the use of AI, as part of a wider Labour AI strategy. There’s also a new open letter (is that the furthest we’ve got into a Data Policy Digest before mentioning one?) and grouping from [Technology Entrepreneurs, Investors and Executives Supporting The Labour Party](https://www.labourtech.org/).

There was also [some praise for Labour’s tech approach in the New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics-interview/2024/01/george-freeman-labour-government) from… recently departed (Conservative) science minister. George Freeman. He also wrote about the [importance of a cross-party consensus on science, innovation and tech](https://georgefreemanmp.substack.com/p/why-we-need-a-cross-party-consensus) on his new Substack (in a post likely to be remembered most for [its mortgage revelation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68133873)). 

Both Welsh leadership contenders have published manifestos. Jeremy Miles’ includes [better use of data and AI in health](https://www.jeremymiles.wales/wp-content/themes/JMilesBlueStag/manifesto/JeremyMiles-Manifesto-Digital-English.pdf) (including prevention, and scrutinising where services are not meeting the needs of minorities) and building ‘a dedicated data science and Artificial Intelligence capability within the government’, while Vaughan Gething’s includes [innovation in healthcare](https://www.vaughanforleader.cymru/manifesto) and a digital pass for public services (and possibly more, but most of the PDF isn’t searchable)... and…

Keir Starmer’s [speech to the Civil Society Summit](https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/keir-starmers-speech-to-civil-society-summit/) talked about the importance of partnership and empowering communities… Peter Kyle is on a visit to the US this week ‘to discuss [safely exploiting tech](https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1754183609534026011) innovation in a fast changing world’, from where he [spoke to Laura Kuenssberg](https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1754180464984649839) (see Bills, bills, bills, above)... there’s some more digital, data and tech detail (on top of what was already in the party’s [health mission](https://labour.org.uk/missions/nhs/)) in a new [Child Health Action Plan](https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/labours-child-health-action-plan-will-create-the-healthiest-generation-of-children-ever/)… Peter Kyle was [doing the rounds](https://twitter.com/BestForBritain/status/1752274527411659094) talking about [Labour’s life sciences plan](https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-welcomes-labour-s-life-sciences-plan.html)… and Ofcom chief Melanie Dawes and former DCMS perm sec Sarah Healey are among those profiled in the FT as [possible Labour choices for the UK’s next top civil servant](https://www.ft.com/content/ea5b365f-b825-4902-8707-959b12f11151). 


## **On the Horizon**

Our very own Jeni asked [What does the Post Office scandal teach us about data and AI regulation?](https://connectedbydata.org/blog/2024/01/17/post-office-lessons) ([quoted by Politico](https://pro.politico.eu/news/surveillance-bill-lands-back-in-the-lords) in their UK Morning Technology newsletter)... [‘Time for data protection law reforms to honour the postmasters’](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/data-protection-law-reforms-honour-postmasters-horizon-comment-726kh985f), wrote Natalie Byrom in The Times… The Big Issue looked at how [the scandal proves why workers’ needs must be put ahead of AI and technology](https://www.bigissue.com/news/employment/post-office-scandal-technology-ai-protect-workers/)… Nature ran a piece entitled [‘Computers make mistakes and AI will make things worse — the law must recognize that’](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00168-8)... and as noted above, Tim Clement-Jones has [a Lords question](https://lordsbusiness.parliament.uk/ItemOfBusiness?itemOfBusinessId=135979&sectionId=38&businessPaperDate=2024-02-12) on independent testing of computer systems which feels rather Horizon-flavoured.
