We were pleased to support the research and writing of the Wales' TUC report entitled "A snapshot of workers in Wales’ understanding and experience of AI".

<!--more-->

"This report summarises key themes from research conducted by Wales TUC on how trade unionists in Wales understand and are engaging with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their workplaces.

The research found that there is a high degree of general awareness by workers that AI is already impacting or will impact their working lives. However, the level of engagement with AI is specific to context, technology and sector. There are cross-cutting concerns spanning this varied experience, including implications for equalities". (Text quoted from Executive Summary)
