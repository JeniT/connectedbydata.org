Hello, and welcome to our twentieth Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. 

Going through the motions, too cautious, little spark, relief that it will soon be over, and little mention of data and tech… enough about England and Scotland at the Euros, the general election is a week today. And [civil society](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) tried to inject some data and AI discussion into the campaign with [two](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-25-general-election-event) [events](https://www.youtube.com/live/-gFkZQaxt5A) this week - more below.

## **Never mind the ballots** {#ballots}
If you’ve not already bookmarked it/made it your homepage/pledged to vote for it on 4 July, we’ve set up [a Data and AI Civil Society Network Election Hub](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/data-ai-civil-society-election-hub). We’ll be updating with resources throughout the campaign - and you can add to it, too! (And if you’d like to find out more about the network, visit our [dedicated website](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/).)


### **Manifesto destiny** {#manifesto}
On Monday, the **Democratic Unionist Party** launched [their manifesto](https://mydup.com/policies/general-election-2024). There’s a short section on AI, about ‘harness[ing] the potential of Artificial Intelligence and smart data to build stronger communities and drive economic growth’ while recognising ‘significant risk. We will oppose plans to allow AI developers to use existing music, literature and works of art without permission or payment and disregarding copyright laws. DUP MPs will also seek more robust, but proportionate, regulation of data and emerging technologies in order to crack down on abuse, harmful practices such deepfakes and efforts to undermine democracy through misinformation and disinformation.’... there’s a pledge to campaign for a ‘national database of public land’... another to establish ‘clusters of universities, business and clinicians throughout the UK to harness and accelerate the use of new medical technology and diagnostics’ and ‘support accessible and portable health information throughout a patient’s life’... and close to a whole page (p43) on Online Harm, where the promise to ‘campaign to end the ‘Wild West’ of social media and to protect children and all internet users from harm, abuse and misinformation online’ includes a ‘rapid review of emerging risks from AI’ and supporting progress on ‘stronger rights for bereaved parents in accessing their child’s social media profiles and data’. 

I can’t actually find the **SDLP** manifesto, launched on Wednesday, online - though the [BBC summary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c511y8yyevjo) doesn’t have anything obviously data-relevant. I couldn’t find anything in the **Sinn Féin** [manifesto](https://vote.sinnfein.ie/sinn-fein-launches-manifesto-for-positive-change/) either.

While we’re on manifestos… Defend Digital Me has [scrutinised party plans on digital and education](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/06/22/general-election-2024-scrutinising-party-plans-on-digital-and-education/)… the Digital Poverty Alliance has looked at the Conservative (‘[All Quiet on the Digital Poverty Front](https://digitalpovertyalliance.org/news-updates/the-conservative-party-released-its-manifesto/)’), Labour (‘[Taking the Poverty out of Digital Poverty](https://digitalpovertyalliance.org/news-updates/labour-party-releases-its-manifesto/)’) and [other manifestos](https://digitalpovertyalliance.org/news-updates/review-of-all-party-manifestos/)… and there’s also [Assessing the manifestos against our calls for change](https://fullfact.org/blog/2024/jun/assessing-the-manifestos-against-our-calls-for-change/) (Full Fact)... and [2024 UK General Election: 4 ways the next government can make the internet safer](https://counterhate.com/blog/2024-uk-general-election-4-ways-the-next-government-can-make-the-internet-safer/) (Center for Countering Digital Hate).

### **Labour movement** {#labour}
How might a Labour government reorganise the machinery around data and digital? Will Perrin (ex-No 10 under a previous Labour government) [unpacks Peter Kyle’s London tech week speech](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organisation-digital-labour-government-unpacking-tech-william-tjhuf/) (Will Perrin). He also refers to a Wes Streeting appearance at a [Medical Journalists’ Association event](https://mjauk.org/2024/06/19/street-talking-winter-is-coming/): Digital Health has most on data, [Wes Streeting slams ‘glacial’ pace of FDP adoption](https://www.digitalhealth.net/2024/06/wes-streeting-slams-glacial-pace-of-fdp-adoption/), though the MJA also links to other coverage. Global Counsel also has a podcast, on [How will a Labour government approach tech policy?](https://global-counsel.com/insights/podcast/how-will-labour-government-approach-tech-policy) 

If you’re interested in workers’ rights on data and AI… Labour has previously committed to [a Single Enforcement Body](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/good-work-plan-establishing-a-new-single-enforcement-body-for-employment-rights), which will now be called the Fair Work Agency: [Labour watchdog will have ‘real teeth’ to prosecute rogue employers, says Angela Rayner](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/23/labour-fair-work-agency-teeth-prosecutive-employers-angela-rayner), according to The Observer. Let’s see if that includes digital rights.

And Politico also highlighted a Labour press release about R&D plans, which includes AI as one of six priority areas (alongside aerospace, automotives, defence, energy and life sciences). Not sure that bit has been written up anywhere not paywalled, but[ Yahoo News carry the broader Press Association report](https://au.news.yahoo.com/labour-pledge-relight-fire-regions-213000646.html). 


### **News Tory** {#tory}
Is there any point, really?

### **Everything else** {#everything}
Tuesday was civil society data and AI election event extravaganza day!

It started at 4.30pm with our Question Time-style debate, [Who should Labour listen to on AI, tech and public services?](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-25-general-election-event), with our own Jeni Tennison, the Tony Blair Institute’s Jeegar Kakkad, Nesta’s James Plunkett and Public Law Project’s Caroline Selman, chaired by the FT’s John Thornhill. You can [read a summary](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-25-general-election-event) or [watch it back in full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ-tdt74-KA).

Then, in the evening - and infinitely preferable to any football that may have been on, or so I understand - came a hustings on [‘digital rights in the age of AI’](https://www.youtube.com/live/-gFkZQaxt5A), organised by ORG with us, Big Brother Watch, Defend Digital Me, the Open Data Institute, Worker Info Exchange and Institute for the Future of Work. Author and broadcaster Timandra Harkness chaired Viscount Camrose for the Tories, Lord Clement-Jones for the Lib Dems, and Cllr Jack Lenox for the Greens, Labour conspicuous by their absence. You can also [watch that back in full](https://www.youtube.com/live/-gFkZQaxt5A).

Elsewhere… AI and IP apparently came up at the Creative UK hustings (h/t Politico), with Labour’s Chris Bryant pointing to [Labour’s Plan for the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Labours-Arts-Culture-Creative-Industries-Sector-Plan.pdf) (try page 6 for the headline and page 17 for more)... the Online Safety Act and scams came up at [the MoneySavingExpert hustings](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2024/06/the-mse-leaders--debate-2024/#scams) (again, h/t Politico)… the Royal Statistical Society has asked [parties to commit to basic stats training for ministers](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/rss-asks-parties-to-commit-to-basic-stats-training-for-ministers) (Civil Service World)... 

Channel 4 asks [‘Can AI steal your vote?’](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/can-ai-steal-your-vote-dispatches)... Full Fact have been [using AI to support their debate factchecking](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-election-latest-updates-2024-live-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-nigel-farage/#1300203) (Politico)... though [Politicians’ claims rather than AI fakes have kept UK election fact-checkers busy](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/politicians-claims-rather-than-ai-fakes-have-kept-uk-election-fact-checkers-busy/) (Press Gazette)... and Politico’s Digital Bridge also [struggles to find deepfake impact](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/digital-bridge/uks-digital-election-snoozefest/) (while its Influence newsletter looks at [the effect video doorbells](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/politico-london-influence/ring-doorbells-cause-campaign-chaos-2/) are having).
