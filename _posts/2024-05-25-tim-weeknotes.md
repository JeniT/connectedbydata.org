Lots of things moving forward this week. 

**A prototype set of cards [for the Governance Game](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-governance-game) are with the printers** (thanks to sterling work from Jess, Virgil and Emily) hopefully ariving in time for me to test them out with participants of the British Retail Consortium Summer School on 5th June, where I'll be taking part as contributor on data and AI governance. 

At our team co-working day on Monday we reviewed the draft of the cards, and updated the branding of the resource (I little realised the connotations others read into the working title of 'Governance Stack'! so that is now well and truly dropped). Still to do: I need to update the webpages for the projects, including providing a print-and-play downloadable version, and guide to using the cards as a workshop resource. 

**Interviews for the GCA on AI project are gathering steam** as I have had chance over the last few weeks to talk with Fernando Perini, Bruce Schnier, Gloria Guerro, Tiago Piexoto, Anna Collom, Antoine Verne and Matt Ryan. I've lots of notes to review and code, and quite a few more interviews I'm looking forward to, but I'm already getting a good picture of some of the issues we'll need to tackle in exploring options for global AI deliberations: as well as some of the contrasting positions around the topic, scope, structure and strategies that different stakeholders would be interested in. Weekly conversations on the emerging findings with Claire Mellier are providing a wealth of insight, and I've [just signed up for a perfectly timed weekly seminars over June run by GloCan on the convening, governing, grounding and docking global deliberation](https://glocan.org/events/).

It was also fantastic to be able to host the first workshop for the project in Brussels yesterday, written up here. 

**While we heard that our proposal into the Data Empowerment Fund for a programme of working building on the People's Panel on AI was not one of the 2 or 3% that made it through selection**, we did get news that a smaller project we've proposed with the Public Voices on AI programme of RAI UK is hopefully going to be moving forward. More than in the next few weeks, but it will hopefully be an exciting opportunity to make connections between a number of different local deliberative processes, and to explore how we support ongoing [pathways for participation for citizens engaged around AI](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/participation-pathways-designing-for-effective-engagement). 

**We had some good team conversations about [our data campaigns design lab coming up on 20th June](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/participation-pathways-designing-for-effective-engagement)** and I'm delighted we're going to be working with Dirk Slater on it. Adam and I got to take part in one of Dirk's 'Fascilitating Collective Power' workshops earlier this year, as part of building the [Collective Power Playbook](https://collectivepower.net), and I'm really excited to explore how we can link to that work when thinking about resources for communities running campaigns around data. 

**We had [a great connected conversation](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-05-23-connected-conversation-public-deliberation-resources) reflecting on progress since our Hawkwood residential on meaningful deliberation on data and AI** and it was great to hear about the resources and conversations that have developed since then. Write-up from that coming soon. 

Oh, and of course, an election was called - and the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was thrown out in washup. 

Half-term next week, so hopefully a bit quieter! I'm looking forward through to [moderating discussions for the Data Values Project on Wednesday on this call](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-05-29-data-values): do register and join us if you can.
