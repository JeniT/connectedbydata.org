Hello, and welcome to our 28th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments.

And Happy New Year! I hope you had a wonderful Christmas, and a relaxing break from all things data and AI (with the exception of [Wallace and Gromit’s terrific take on technology](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0022179/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl)).

Some big Data Policy Digest news to kick off your 2025: **this will be the last edition in this form with Connected by Data**. The Digest, along with our other [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) activity, was funded out of [a grant from JRRT](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-jrrt-influencing), and we were sadly unsuccessful in the latest round of applications. A massive thank you to JRRT for their funding to date; to the whole team at Connected by Data for being brilliant; and of course, to all of you for subscribing and reading.

<!--more-->

We’re currently pondering what’s next for the Digest - perhaps a paid-for Substack, perhaps a new home, or perhaps some new funding will come through, but we do need some money from somewhere to continue. If you’d like to help shape the future of the Digest, [our feedback survey is still open](https://forms.gle/R9gHgFePV8Ypzge17) - thanks to those who’ve responded so far - or you can [email me directly](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com).

This started as a pop-up newsletter way back in April 2023 to cover the previous government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. It would be fair to say a lot has happened since - so much so, it’s felt more permanent than pop-up and keeping it to a ‘Digest’ has felt like an aspiration rather than the reality. Thanks for sticking with it, and for all the suggestions, links and kind words. Hopefully this is the end of the beginning, rather than the end.

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via [gavin@gavinfreeguard.com](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com). A reminder that Connected by Data is on Bluesky [@connectedbydata.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.bsky.social). You can also [catch up on previous Digests](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-data-policy-digest).

## **Data policy developments** {#data-policy-developments}

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}
**Data (Use and Access) Bill (DUAB):** The Bill completed its Lords Committee stage during December. This is where the [Lords went through the Bill clause by clause](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/november/data-use-and-access-bill-faces-first-checks-in-lords/) - because it was a [grand committee](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62fe365fe90e0703e1bb4844/2022-08_Guide_to_Making_Legislation_-_master_version__4_.pdf#page=256), [amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19280/amendments) were not voted on and only made if they were agreed unanimously, so expect to see a lot of similar ones return in future stages. The next stage is [Report stage](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19404), on 21 January and 28 January, which continues the [detailed examination of the Bill](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/lords/lrds-lords-report-stage/) and will include voting on amendments.

You can catch up on the four days of debate at [Committee stage](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19280):
* [3 December](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-12-03/debates/6620286C-14E6-498E-8E12-3B1D2EA9E4CB/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)), where subjects discussed included smart data, digital verification services (digital identity), data on sex and gender, cybersecurity, the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR), and data on births and deaths
* [10 December](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-12-10/debates/0FC43302-4C6D-4676-A6B5-E369366CA99F/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)), including scientific research, consent and notification, recognised legitimate interests, children’s data, a bit on copyright and processing of personal data by private companies and rights ([Defend Digital Me have a write-up,](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/12/11/dua-bill-committee-stage-day-2-humanrightsday-2024-dataprotection/) noting it was International Human Rights Day)
* [16 December](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-12-16/debates/90BA207A-2205-4E76-9383-CBA8B39F0599/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)), including a continuation of the discussion on rights, AI (including AI model development and children’s rights), advertising and marketing data, enforcement of data rights, automated decision making and processing by law enforcement and security services
* [18 December](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-12-18/debates/A1CA5CDE-6F55-42E6-8153-31F3FFB302E4/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)), including children’s data, the Computer Misuse Act and cybersecurity, independent researcher access to data around online safety, national security and data privacy risks, AI and child sexual abuse material and deepfakes, copyright, reliability of computer-based evidence, data assets held in the public interest, data centre energy usage, environmental data, and some government amendments on the ICO and immigration data.

Remember - if you’re a civil society org interested in the Bill, there’s a dedicated working group you can join as part of the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/).

Other bits and pieces around the Bill… 

There’s been lots on **digital identity** over the last few weeks… [drink it in](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pubgoers-given-choice-to-prove-age-with-phones-next-year-in-boost-for-high-street-and-hospitality-sectors), as DSIT press released the possible use for age verification in pubs (though in the US, [age verification and porn](https://www.404media.co/pornhub-is-now-blocked-in-almost-all-of-the-u-s-south/) is the story)… the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes published interim findings [on the digital identity sector](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-sectoral-analysis-interim-findings)… Biometric Update detected [growing support in the UK press](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202412/uk-press-won-over-on-digital-id-sets-about-explaining-why-to-the-public), including from the Times (which [muddles government ID](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/digital-ids-pubs-clubs-alcohol-licensing-laws-7wz3l8jqw) with the different framework proposed by the Bill), [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4d71d781-45f9-4c1a-816d-c3a1dd73f53e) (see also this [social media discussion](https://bsky.app/profile/rachelcoldicutt.bsky.social/post/3ldeu7uqlq22l)) and in the Mail (where [a certain former prime minister](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14182429/TONY-BLAIR-Taxes-NHS-disruption-change-everything.html) continues to think digital ID is the solution to everything), although [GB News is less positive](https://www.gbnews.com/money/digital-id-government-cash-control-finances)… Labour Together also wrote about [shifting attitudes](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=dc861bbf66a1af0216e43f80a&id=f5b1f74909)… and Sex Matters wrote (and briefed peers) about [digital identity](https://sex-matters.org/posts/updates/theres-still-a-fatal-flaw-in-the-governments-digital-trust-framework/) too…

There was [some](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/loophole-protecting-ai-firms-over-child-abuse-images-to-close-q9lxww7jn) [coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/07/labour-to-make-taking-intimate-images-without-consent-a-criminal-offence) around **CSAM and deepfake image abuse**, which will be introduced [via a different Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-crackdown-on-explicit-deepfakes) (see [written ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-07/hcws354) and also Baroness Owen’s private member’s bill, below)...

Lord Holmes [wrote for Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Regulating-automated-decision-making-in-the-Data-Use-and-Access-Bill) about **automated decision making** (and [a few](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/The-Data-Bill-Its-time-to-cyber-up) [other things](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Here-comes-the-governments-Data-Bill-again)), while techUK had [a briefing dedicated to the subject](https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-briefing-on-automated-decision-making-in-the-data-use-and-access-bill.html), Big Brother Watch wrote about the Bill [opening the floodgates to AI](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/blog/city-a-m-the-notebook-labours-data-bill-could-open-the-floodgates-to-ai-why-is-no-one-talking-about-it/), and there have been developments on algorithmic transparency (see DSIT up and take notice, below)…

Ofcom’s [call for evidence on researcher access to data](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/call-for-evidence-researchers-access-to-information-from-regulated-online-services/) remains open until 17 January… the Police Federation supported an amendment around the ‘[bureaucratic burden’](https://www.polfed.org/news/latest-news/2024/police-federation-backed-amendment-to-data-protection-act-brought-before-house-of-lords/) on officers… DSIT tweeted [something seasonal about NUAR](https://x.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1869309979116916959)…

Connected by Data was one of the signatories to [a letter on automated decision making, organised by ORG](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/letter-to-peter-kyle-keep-our-right-not-to-be-subjected-to-decisions-based-solely-on-ai/)… there are general briefings/campaigns/summaries from the [Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/blogs/westminster-update-lord-chancellor-gives-update-on-legal-aid-funding) ([twice](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/blogs/westminster-update-criminal-courts-review-announced), [thrice](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/blogs/westminster-update-evidence-on-digital-assets)), [the Local Government Association](https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/data-use-and-access-bill), the law firm [Squire Paton Boggs](https://www.privacyworld.blog/2024/12/unpacking-the-proposed-data-use-and-access-bill/), [Keep Our NHS Public](https://keepournhspublic.com/five-things-you-should-know-about-the-new-data-use-and-access-bill/) (and [another](https://keepournhspublic.com/labour-data-use-and-access-bill-and-use-of-nhs-data/))... IAPP had a piece on [ICO, UK government detail potential impacts of proposed data reforms](https://iapp.org/news/a/ico-uk-government-detail-potential-impacts-of-proposed-data-reform)…

And… as for things not in the Bill, but that were in the previous government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill… the latest [annual report from the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/biometrics-and-surveillance-camera-commissioner-report-2023-to-2024) (which DPDIB would have abolished) says government needs to pay more attention and think about its place in the regulatory landscape… and [Lord Sikka reminds us](https://leftfootforward.org/2024/12/labours-lurch-to-the-right-could-risk-keir-starmer-being-a-one-term-prime-minister/) that the controversial DWP powers dropped from this Bill will appear elsewhere.

**AI Bill:** We still await details of a narrow frontier-focused Bill, expected to put the AI Safety Institute on a statutory footing and make voluntary agreements between government and industry mandatory, accompanied by a consultation (which we understand may go wider).

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill:** [Coming in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill). Meanwhile… the National Cyber Security Centre published its [annual review](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/ncsc-annual-review-2024)… their new head made their [first speech](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/03/uk-underestimates-threat-of-cyber-attacks-from-hostile-states-and-gangs-says-security-chief)… Infosecurity Magazine says 2025 is [A Critical Year for Cybersecurity Compliance in the EU and UK](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/2025-critical-year-cybersecurity/)… [Evaluation of the Northern Ireland Cyber AI Hub programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-northern-ireland-cyber-ai-hub-programme) (DSIT)... and [Cyber attack costing six-figure sum, council says](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0nvr1910lo) (BBC).

**Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill:** This is in a [Special Public Bill Committee](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5486/special-public-bill-committee) which is [taking evidence](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/746/property-digital-assets-etc-bill-hl-special-public-bill-committee/events/) (next hearing: 9 January). The [Lords Library](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0062/) and [Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/Topics/Private-client/Whats-changing/Property-Digital-Assets-etc-Bill) have briefings.

**Other King’s Speech Bills:** The [Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909) had its second reading in the Commons on Wednesday, the first opportunity for MPs to debate its contents. Data-related measures include information sharing through a children’s number and a register of children not in school. [Defend Digital Me has more](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/12/17/childrens-wellbeing-and-schools-bill-more-questions-than-answers/) on the Bill, and [more general reflections on 2024 and pupil data](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/12/30/a-reflection-on-2024-for-pupil-data-in-england-and-beyond/). Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said an amendment from the Tories, on an inquiry into grooming gangs (see Musk Odour, below), [would kill the bill and is ‘utterly sickening’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgngd52z71o) - given Labour’s majority, the amendment was not expected to pass, [and it didn’t](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvy4q82l9o).

Meanwhile, the [Product Regulation and Metrology Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3752) awaits a date for Lords report stage, and the [Employment Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3737) has some Commons committee sessions to come.

**Online Safety Act:** As ever, check out the [Online Safety Act Network](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/) and [their newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/a1956b0126b5/osa-network-online-safety-newsletter-17436007) for more, but some things which caught my attention…

Peter Kyle made [a written ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-12-16/hcws312) on the Act’s implementation on 16 December, and the following day DSIT published [illegal content codes of practice 2024 and explanatory memorandum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-illegal-content-codes-of-practice-2024-explanatory-memorandum)… while Ofcom published its [first major policy Statement for the Online Safety regime](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-people-from-illegal-harms-online/), appointed [a new head of online safety](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/structure-and-leadership/ofcom-appoints-oliver-griffiths-as-group-director-online-safety/ ), still has an [open consultation](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/call-for-evidence-researchers-access-to-information-from-regulated-online-services/) on researcher access to data from social media platforms, and apologised for an ['ill-judged' porn joke job ad](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clygj1l4yweo)… 

London Fixed Gear and Single-Speed (a community of cyclists in and around London) attracted some attention for [announcing it will shut down due to the OSA](https://www.lfgss.com/conversations/401475/)… and with perfect timing, Promising Trouble have posted [Five things you need if you run a small, low-risk user-to-user service](https://buttondown.com/indie-and-community-web-compliance-/archive/2-five-things-you-need-if-you-run-a-small-low)…

Lots more on children and phones… [Australian-style social media ban for under-16s is highly unlikely, says Tech Secretary](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32568457/social-media-ban-axed-technology-secretary/) (The Sun)...

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act:** The CMA [sets out initial plans as new digital markets competition regime comes into force](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-initial-plans-as-new-digital-markets-competition-regime-comes-into-force) - [How the UK’s digital markets competition regime works](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-the-uks-digital-markets-competition-regime-works)… TechRepublic has [a briefing on the Act](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/uk-digital-markets-competition-consumers-act/)… and the chief exec of the CMA and senior director of the Digital Markets Unit gave evidence on 7 January to the [Lords’ Communications and Digital Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/22842).

**Private Member’s Bills:** PMBs are unlikely to pass without government support, but there are some relevant ones around at the moment… 

Josh McAlister’s [Protection of Children (Digital Safety and Data Protection)](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3778) Bill has its Second Reading in March - [he spoke to The House](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/josh-macalister-social-media-children) magazine about it, while the Molly Rose Foundation [critiqued its proposal for a digital age of consent](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/raising-digital-age-consent-isnt-best-approach-online-safety)…

Lord Clement-Jones’ [Public Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision-Making Systems Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3760) had [its second reading](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-12-13/debates/AA0C1C17-11FA-410E-A394-846703400F55/PublicAuthorityAlgorithmicAndAutomatedDecision-MakingSystemsBill(HL)) (highlights include Baroness Lane-Fox, [chair of DSIT’s advisory panel](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-experts-to-shape-government-digital-vision-to-drive-innovation-and-boost-public-services) on the digital centre, describing ‘the engine of the Government’s AI plans’ as ‘truly a horror show’, and see also the [Lords Library briefing](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0071/))...

But arguably Baroness Owen’s [Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Images and Videos (Offences) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3759/stages), which also had [its second reading](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-12-13/debates/95C70542-3B53-4D50-BF46-0CDF69BA083B/Non-ConsensualSexuallyExplicitImagesAndVideos(Offences)Bill(HL)) (see [Lords Library briefing](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0070/)), has received the most attention - she [wrote for The Times](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/charlotte-owen-deepfake-porn-is-abuse-lets-make-it-illegal-v8znpzlj2) and [spoke to The House](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/rise-ai-porn-the-levels-deepfake-abuse-now-enormous). Minister Jess Phillips [told the Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/online-creeps-used-photos-make-34397584) she had spoken to Owen, and the government has now [announced its own measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-crackdown-on-explicit-deepfakes) (the previous Sunak government had [promised something](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cracks-down-on-deepfakes-creation), too).


### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}
Let’s try to keep this snappy, he says, weeping at just how many data and AI-relevant announcements there have been since our last edition. Strap in, everyone.

**The traditional centre:** Technology is key to reforming the state, [which should be more like a start-up](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pat-mcfadden-vows-to-make-the-state-more-like-a-start-up-as-he-deploys-reform-teams-across-country). That was one of the main messages in [a major public sector reform speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/reform-of-the-state-has-to-deliver-for-the-people) from Chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden. (For clarity, he meant it being agile, iterative and adaptive, rather than it making inflated claims before being bought by big tech.) The Guardian’s Andrew Sparrow [transcribed the Q&A and some other reaction](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/09/uk-politics-live-pat-mcfadden-labour-civil-service-reform-rachel-reeves-eu-relationship?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-6756d3f58f0805d974b98a54#block-6756d3f58f0805d974b98a54). The speech came after the government’s [missions](https://www.gov.uk/missions)/[Plan for Change](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plan-for-change) relaunch (see also: [written ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-12-05/hcws285)), and tried to water down PM Keir Starmer’s [‘tepid bath of managed decline’](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/starmer-too-many-civil-servants-comfortable-in-tepid-bath-of-managed-decline) comments about civil servants.

McFadden was also in front of the [Commons PACAC committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/22572/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) the next day, while Starmer himself touched on the importance of [AI and digital skills](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/starmer-acknowledges-skills-challenges-facing-civil-service) during his appearance at [the Liaison Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/22827/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) (made up of all Commons select committee chairs) the following week. AI and copyright also came up (more on that below). The PM also met [Apple](https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-pm-starmer-meet-apple-ceo-discuss-investment-2024-12-11/) and mentioned AI at the [Lord Mayor’s Banquet](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-lord-mayors-banquet-2-december-2024), in talks [with the president of the UAE](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-the-president-of-the-united-arab-emirates-9-december-2024), and with [President Macron](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-president-macron-9-january-2025) (the AI Action Summit happens in Paris in February, and Starmer also [caught up with Mistral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/keir-starmer_with-my-government-the-uk-will-be-a-global-activity-7283170028965789698-dtgM/)). Foreign Sec David Lammy also wants to [bring AI to the heart](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-locarno-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary-9-january-2025) of his department’s work. Starmer also [asked regulators for ideas on boosting growth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0n14ywzqpo).

The new head of the civil service, Chris Wormald, talked about [using tech to do things differently](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/civil-servants-will-need-to-do-things-differently-wormald-delivers-first-message-to-officials) in his first message to civil servants - while his predecessor Simon Case [touched on tech in a farewell lecture](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/simon-case-cabinet-secretary-strand-group-lecture).

The Chancellor [launched](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8ewdzgnx1yo) the [next phase](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-every-pound-spent-will-deliver-plan-for-change) of the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/what-is-a-spending-review), expected around June (more in [our last edition](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/12/02/data-policy-digest#dsit-up-and-take-notice)) - expect some discussion of tech solutions to waste and efficiency as departmental budgets face cuts, which could be deeper than expected [according to The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/09/rachel-reeves-cuts-public-services-borrowing-costs-tax). On which, Rachel Reeves was also apparently annoyed by [having to change her address on her driving licence](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/keir-starmer-labour-relaunch-mission-impossible-ccq9bfksw) in person - which caused [some scepticism on social media](https://bsky.app/profile/oldtrotter.bsky.social/post/3lcsyqybh2222). The government has also appointed its [Industrial Strategy Advisory Council](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-12-17/hcws319).

And on a final fiscal note, the [Scottish Budget](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-budget-2025-2026/) had a [‘mixed picture’ on digital](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/12/10/business-and-industry/scottish-budget-delivers-digital-mixed-picture/), while the [Welsh one](https://www.gov.wales/draft-budget-2025-2026) included some [digital health tech](https://htn.co.uk/2024/12/13/draft-budget-2025-26-for-wales-600m-extra-revenue-and-capital-funding-for-health-and-social-care-with-promise-for-investment-in-digital-tech/) and [digital planning processes](https://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/articles/cbi-responds-to-draft-welsh-government-budget-2025-26/).

**The digital centre:** Personnel changes at the top, with former DG of CDDO, [Joanna Davinson](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/joanna-davinson ), returning to government as interim chief digital officer and [leader of the digital centre](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/12/16/government-and-politics/joanna-davinson-returns-as-government-cdo-and-leader-of-new-digital-centre)… her predecessor, Mike Potter, [shared some insights on public sector innovation](https://www.government-transformation.com/innovation/fostering-innovation-in-the-public-sector-insights-from-mike-potter)… and Laura Gilbert, former head of 10DS and i.AI and joint chief analyst at the Cabinet Office [departing government](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7275527879814242305-v2qw/) for the [Ellison Institute of Technology](https://www.eit.org/news/university-of-oxford-and-ellison-institute-of-technology-join-forces-to-address-humanitys-greatest-challenges-in-a-transformative-strategic-alliance) at Oxford.

I don’t think he’s said anything about Elon Musk (see Musk odour, below).

It’s been a long wait - Clifford’s declared interests suggesting he [completed his work back in September](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/matt-cliffords-declared-outside-interests/matt-cliffords-declared-outside-interests) - with Politico suggesting it’s been held up by PM Starmer wanting to launch it (and therefore a slot in the media grid needing to be found).

The government [launched](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-12-18/debates/447E0399-22CE-46AC-809B-421D728C0ECE/CopyrightAndArtificialIntelligence) its [expected](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consults-on-proposals-to-give-creative-industries-and-ai-developers-clarity-over-copyright-laws) [consultation on copyright and AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence) (a week after ministers were [quizzed by a Lords committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/22621)) - it closes 25 February.

If you’re in a consultation kind of mood - the government’s [Technology Adoption Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/technology-adoption-review) is open until 14 February (what better use of Valentine’s Day etc). 

And DSIT is consulting on [‘plans for a new collection of public engagement data’](https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/dsit-central-statistics-user-engagement-exercise) (closes 31 January).
