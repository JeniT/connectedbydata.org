When I joined **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** I was encouraged to do Weeknotes. It wasn't something I'd ever come across so I scoured the internet looking for inspiration and understanding. I wish there'd been this resource by [Giles Turnbull](https://www.usethehumanvoice.com/) which I will now recommend to any new starters we have.

I'm very flattered to have my "week" notes included as an example in a new [doingweeknotes.com](doingweeknotes.com) resource he has developed (but I'd recommend this resource regardless!).

### What I’ve been doing
The last couple of weeks have been wrangling new project budgets and stand ups. We’re also preparing for end of financial year accountancy with a new firm and are going to become VAT registered (which is a good thing but honestly a responsibility I am nervous of / keen to ensure I learn deeply about).

We’ve held a couple of [Connected Conversations](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-connected-conversations) that I did the note taking at and for both created the first draft of the writeup (we look to publish these within five weeks of the event).  One was about the [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai) and as Tim said when the speakers had all arrived - it was like getting the gang back together (and I loved that).


### What I need to take care of
I suspect accountancy is going to fill most of my coming weeks.  As mentioned we’re with a new accountancy firm for end of year accounts, we need to do our accrual work, we need to complete our VAT registration and understand how that impacts on our bookkeeping - and I have my [Bookkeeping Transactions and Controls Part 1](https://www.pitman-training.com/our-courses/bookkeeping-transactions-and-controls-part-1/) exam in a few weeks.


### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
Perhaps “inspiration” is slightly overstating it but I’ve really loved time spent in GatherTown recently.  We’ve got our own office space and from co-working to quick chats it has certainly achieved (for me) some element of replicating an office.  I particularly enjoyed a leaving do we had for a colleague where we ended up playing what was essentially pictionary - it felt relaxed, fun, social despite us being scattered across the UK / world. I also learned that I really struggle to spell broccoli!  (if I don’t have autocorrect to help).


### What I’ve been reading
I’ve lost my mojo.  Even Secret Seven hasn’t been helping that unusually.  And it is frustrating as I have books I want to read and some I’m excited to read. #MustDoBetter
