## **Data policy developments**
### **Deeply DPDIB**

Believed dead, but then resurrected…

Yes, it’s the [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications), which disappeared from parliament in September 2022 only to be reintroduced the following March. And it’s now made it to Lords Committee Stage, where [the Lords will go through it line by line](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/march/data-protection-and-digital-information-bill-subject-to-lords-line-by-line-scrutiny/) and the [many suggested amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/18402/amendments) in great detail. Though remember: because this is ‘grand committee’, amendments can only be made unanimously - expect a lot of them to be withdrawn following discussion, and to return in future stages…

**[In the first session](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-03-20/debates/C8829C8F-A83E-40FA-A169-F3C4B6483E0E/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill)** (20 March), amendments debated covered definitions and identifiability of personal data… data controllers having a duty to identify when a user might be a child, extra protection for children… definition of scientific research… [data communities](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/18402/amendments/10012949)… amendments all withdrawn.

Lord Tim Clement-Jones (Lib Dem) thanked the civil society organisations who had been in touch - 25 had called for the Bill to be dropped and he shared their concerns, thought we were in for a long journey and in need of several wet towels… Lord Steve Bassam (Labour) thought the Bill needed to go back to square one and many others in the committee were of like mind. 

**[In the second session](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-03-25/debates/7C715124-A951-4D37-B410-C6F7BE24E78E/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill)** (25 March), amendments covered lawfulness of processing personal data and ‘recognised legitimate interests’… ‘democratic engagement’, the use of data by political parties and candidates… some ‘technical’ government amendments... vexatious and excessive subject access requests… the use of the open electoral register for marketing purposes… automated decision-making… data processing which convenes the Equality Act to be prohibited… government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn.

We were delighted that [oral evidence](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/17609) from Connected by Data’s Jeni Tennison was [cited by Lord Clement-Jones](https://twitter.com/ConnectedByData/status/1772994439130341533).

**[In the third session](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-03-27/debates/1870CF5A-0B56-4C5C-A6CD-F38192C3CE35/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill)** (27 March), amendments covered automated decision-making… some ‘technical’ government amendments on wording, and on international transfers of law enforcement data… the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard… data protection by design and processors being accountable… logging of law enforcement processing… processing of data by Large Language Models… government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn.

**The next session** will be on Monday 15 April, when the Lords return from recess.

A reminder we have [a collection of resources](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources) on the Bill, including lots of **civil society activity**. As well as [our briefing](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-lords-committee-briefing)… there’s the Public Law Project’s open letter to government about [mandatory transparency reporting for algorithms](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/latest/ministers-urged-to-amend-data-bill-and-make-government-ai-transparent/) (see also, [House of Lords must act now to stop Data Bill weakening rights](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/house-of-lords-must-act-now-to-stop-data-bill-weakening-rights/))... the Open Rights Group with (THEIR WEBSITE’S CAPS, NOT MINE) [THE IMPACT OF THE DATA PROTECTION AND DIGITAL INFORMATION BILL ON DATA USE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/publications/the-impact-of-the-dpdi-bill-on-data-use-for-political-purposes/); from January, [HOW A WEAKER DATA WATCHDOG IMPACTS YOU](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/how-a-weaker-data-watchdog-impacts-you/); [UK DATA PROTECTION PROPOSALS JEOPARDISE ADEQUACY AGREEMENT WARNS EU COMMITTEE](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/uk-data-protection-proposals-jeopardise-adequacy-agreement-warns-eu-committee/), and latest, [BRIEFING: THE ICO ISN’T WORKING AND HOW PARLIAMENT CAN FIX IT](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/publications/briefing-the-ico-isnt-working/) (see also, [thread](https://twitter.com/OpenRightsGroup/status/1772601953031209300))...

### **Bills, bills, bills**

**AI (Regulation) Bill** No, not a late April fool. Such a Bill really exists! But it’s not a government one, as [we’ve touched on before](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/12/19/data-policy-digest).

Conservative peer, Lord Holmes, has [a private members’ bill](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/private-members/) (these tend not to become law) which had [its second reading](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-03-22/debates/381DCD0D-6372-4D01-AD56-310D0FE55CB9/ArtificialIntelligence(Regulation)Bill(HL)) on 22 March. Holmes has [blogged about his Bill](https://lordchrisholmes.com/ethical-ai/) - the [Lords Library has a briefing](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2024-0016/LLN-2024-0016.pdf), and Computer Weekly has a summary, [Lord Holmes: UK cannot 'wait and see' to regulate AI](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366575174/Lord-Holmes-UK-cannot-wait-and-see-to-regulate-AI). Responding for the government, Viscount Camrose recognised the ‘differing views’ on regulation and said the government thought its approach, ‘combining a principles-based framework, international leadership and voluntary measures on developers, is right for today, as it allows us to keep pace with rapid and uncertain advances in AI’. He also said the ‘new, multiagency advisory service known as the AI and digital hub’ being piloted by the regulators in the [Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum](https://www.drcf.org.uk/home) would launch in mid-May, a delay from March according to [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/morning-tech-uk/).

**Online Safety Act** Ofcom has published information about its [power to gather information relating to the death of a child](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/information-for-industry/information-gathering) - this remains the subject of some amendments to the Data Protection Bill, too… the regulator has also [published its approach to categorising online service providers](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consultations-and-statements/category-1/categorisation-research-and-advice) for the purposes of regulation, and the DSIT secretary of state has [written back to them](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/categorisation-of-services-under-the-online-safety-act-dsit-secretary-of-state-letter-to-ofcom)… there’s also been a fair amount of online discussion about a new book from psychologist and author, Jonathan Haidt, and the extent to which social media platforms are impacting children’s mental health - he’s [responded to some reviews](https://twitter.com/JonHaidt/status/1774571680511508601), while [this thread from author Sam Freedman](https://twitter.com/Samfr/status/1774868130939941005) has elicited various responses. Timandra Harkness, meanwhile, has [reviewed a new book from Pete Etchells](https://unherd.com/2024/04/we-need-to-calm-down-about-screen-time/), _Unlocked: The Science of Screen Time_, which takes a different view to Haidt.

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** This is now in ping-pong ([no, really](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/ping-pong/) - or ‘consideration of Lords amendments’ if you prefer, [date tbc](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages)). The Lords [reversed some](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/march/digital-markets-competition-and-consumers-bill-set-for-further-lords-scrutiny/) of the government’s [attempted changes](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/march/lords-completes-examination-digital-markets-competition-and-consumers-bill/) - expect the government to do something about that when it arrives back in the Commons.

**Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill** The Lords will [consider Commons amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508) on 23 April. Concerns from [civil society](https://twitter.com/OpenRightsGroup/status/1772308154522407361) and [from industry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68625232) were not taken on board by MPs at Third Reading. 

**Other** Date is tbc for Commons Report Stage for the [Automated Vehicles Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3506/stages). 

### **AI got ‘rithm**
Lots of international activity this month. Let’s start with Europe and the AI Act: [Artificial Intelligence Act: MEPs adopt landmark law](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19015/artificial-intelligence-act-meps-adopt-landmark-law), says the European Parliament... the BBC describes it as the [‘world's first comprehensive AI law’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68546450)…

Politico looked at the other big European development, a Council of Europe treaty, which it said was [hanging by a thread](https://www.politico.eu/article/council-europe-make-mockery-international-ai-rights-treaty/)… and Euractiv reported concerns from the European Data Protection Supervisor that it had [‘veered far from its original purpose’](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/council-of-europes-proposal-for-ai-convention-is-inadequate-eu-data-watchdog-says/)... while [Belgium will host the EU-US Trade and Technology Council this week](https://belgian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/belgium-to-host-eu-us-trade-and-technology-council-in-april/)… and France has announced its [organising team](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20240329-france-appoints-engineer-to-lead-artificial-intelligence-safety-summit) for the next AI Summit (which may have dropped ‘Safety’ from the title, though I may be reading too much into [two](https://twitter.com/Elysee/status/1773736885870805419) [tweets](https://twitter.com/martintisne/status/1773772923725128077))...

### **DSIT up and take notice**
The Prime Minister has awarded DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis a knighthood and government AI safety stars/tsars Matt Clifford and Ian Hogarth CBEs [for services to AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/honours-and-appointments-march-2024), in an honours list dominated by political appointments, loudly and proudly snuck out with no fanfare late on Maundy Thursday. The Guardian’s Marina Hyde has [an even unkinder take](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/29/california-rishi-sunak-honours-list-regicide). 

As trailed last time, the National Audit Office has published its report on the [Use of artificial intelligence in government](https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-government/) (well worth a read, but in short: government needs to clarify responsibilities and accountabilities and sort out the basics - skills, legacy systems, data sharing - first). Reform ([AI is supposed to automate paperwork, not create more](https://www.cityam.com/ai-is-supposed-to-automate-paperwork-not-create-more/)), [Ada](https://twitter.com/AdaLovelaceInst/status/1768649412585115936) and [Government Transformation](https://www.government-transformation.com/data/nao-government-needs-to-tackle-ai-barriers-to-realise-benefits) magazine have takes. And as surely as night follows day, parliament’s Public Accounts Committee - whose work the NAO supports - [has announced an inquiry](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8367/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-government/), which you have until 3 May to submit evidence to.

### **Parly-vous data?**
Parliament sits next on Monday 15 April. Plenty of time to catch up on the last few weeks - and even put yourself forward for a new job, as [Parliament seeks £140k digital chief to lead three-year tech strategy](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/03/27/education-and-skills/parliament-seeks-140k-digital-chief-to-lead-three-year-tech-strategy/) (Public Technology).

Over the last few weeks… in the Commons, on 12 March PACAC heard from Denise Lievesley (and the Cabinet Office) about [her review of the UK Statistics Authority](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20873)… the same day, the education select committee took evidence on [the OSA and screen time](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20971) and there was a [Ten Minute Rule Bill](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/ten-minute-rule-bill/) on giving people [free access to certain public sector websites](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-03-12/debates/0BDE0389-38B6-4726-B360-FCF699894671/PublicSectorWebsites(DataCharges))… on 13 March, the transport select committee heard more evidence as part of their [future of transport data](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20665) inquiry… on 19 March, the defence select committee continued its [defence AI capabilities](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20631) inquiry… on 26 March, there was a written ministerial statement on data quality affecting [‘healthy start’ statistics](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-03-26/hcws389)… and on 28 March, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, published [her annual report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmpubacc/628/report.html), covering subjects including legacy IT and a lack of data on housing…  

In the Lords… on 12 March, the Science and Tech committee [quizzed DSIT’s Michelle Donelan and Sarah Munby](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20979)… on 19 March, Lord Blunkett asked [a question about electronic payment devices, accessibility and regulation](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-03-19/debates/E2371480-D0EF-4C0F-885D-BD2C9AF6D347/ElectronicPaymentDevices)… the European Affairs select committee kicked off a new inquiry on [‘data adequacy and its implications for the UK-EU relationship’](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/516/european-affairs-committee/news/200436/euac-uk-eu-data-adequacy-cfe/) with [an oral evidence session on 26 March](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21018/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/)… inquiries on [the future of news](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8163/the-future-of-news-impartiality-trust-and-technology) (communications and digital committee) and [electronic border management systems](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8256/electronic-border-management-systems) (justice and home affairs committee) continue… and on 18 March, the joint committee on National Security Strategy heard from the University of Nottingham, Meta, the Turing, Ofcom, the FT and the Electoral Commission with their [first oral evidence session on Defending Democracy](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20327). 

Coming up in the Commons… there are various departmental [question times](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/search?SearchTerm=Oral+Questions+Rota) to look forward to. DSIT questions are on Wednesday 17 April - [questions down to be answered](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47198) include AI regulation, AI in the NHS, protecting personal data, digital inclusion, semiconductors and misinformation (it’s always interesting to see what Tory MPs have put down, as they may be designed to allow the government to talk about certain topics). After that, it’s [DCMS](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47200) questions on Thursday 18 April (there’s nothing down on data and AI, though topical questions could touch on those issues) and [Cabinet Office](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47207) on Thursday 25 April… there are some relevant private members’ bills (unlikely to go anywhere in legislative terms), including on [Public Sector Website Impersonation](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3299) (Labour’s John Spellar), [Online Services (Cancellation)](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal46353) (Natalie Elphicke, Conservative) and [Public Sector Websites (Data Charges)](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47506) (Simon Lightwood, Labour)... and on 16 April, there are Westminster Hall debates on [‘Citizen's assemblies and local democracy’](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47682) and [‘Digital skills and careers’](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47685) which might be of interest.   

In the Lords, the Lords Communications and Digital Committee are expecting a government response to [their report on LLMs](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7827/large-language-models/publications/) by 2 April (government responses to select committees are often late)... the data adequacy inquiry takes [oral evidence on 16 April](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21065/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/), and then [again on 23 and 30 April](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8338/ukeu-data-adequacy)… on 19 April, their lordships [debate the report](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47467) from the Artificial Intelligence in Weapon Systems Committee, '[Proceed with Caution: Artificial Intelligence in Weapon Systems'](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/646/ai-in-weapon-systems-committee/news/198762/government-warned-to-proceed-with-caution-on-ai-in-autonomous-weapons/) (the government [has responded](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-ai-in-weapon-systems-committee-report) to that one)... and on 24 April, Baroness Fox (non-affiliated) has a question on [‘Data collection in the criminal justice system](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47713) to ensure consistency of crime statistics across England and Wales’.


### **Labour movement**

Keir Starmer launched Labour’s local election campaign (2 May) with [a speech](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmers-speech-at-labours-local-election-launch-2024/) - our world ‘needs an end to politics that is done to communities, not with them’ was one line that jumped out for those of us who care about public participation in these things. 

A lot of Labour coverage over the past few weeks has focused on how a Labour government might operate.
