### What I’ve been doing
There’s been a bit of FOMO this week with most of the team away in different corners of the world. Adam, Jeni and Gavin have been up at Labour Party Conference - joint hosting a [drinks reception](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-09-22-labour-conference) ([hear Jeni speak](https://youtu.be/ICWtqioWOBg?si=Yii7tgf8WxxGXBtD)) and then dashing around to various events to hear and influence the discussions.  Tim is across the pond in New York for an event with the UN and launched his (our) [report on Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/global-deliberation-ai). 

Yesterday though I was in a room with the team (other than Tim, now in Washington) for the [final event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-09-26-all-campaigns-are-data-campaigns) for our [community data campaigns cohort](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities). It was fab to meet them in person and hear their lightening presentations about their campaigns (read more here). There was a good turn out of people interested in hearing more about these kinds of campaigns and hopefully lots of good connections made ([hear Jeni’s opening remarks](https://youtu.be/P5ZlXp0hKT4?si=0Cum9pBTIv3KKlF3)). You can [watch this short video](https://youtu.be/PaZ7Xqa9vLg?si=_HvBZJSCth_iKydD) to learn more about the campaigns and the work we’ve been doing with the cohort.

There’s been a fair amount of social media activity around these which has kept me occupied alongside finalising the papers for our next [Governance Board](https://connectedbydata.org/board) meeting and doing a leaver’s discussion with [Helena](https://connectedbydata.org/people/helena-hollis), who is sadly (for us, great for her) leaving us to start a new adventure. She shares her reflections in [her leaver’s blog](https://connectedbydata.org/blog/2024/09/26/helena-leaving-blog).

### What I need to take care of
Next week we’ve got a flurry of online events. I’ll be attending/notetaking at our Connected Conversation on [Global Voices: What does data governance mean to you](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-09-30-connected-conversation-global-voices-on-data-and-ai)?; the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) meeting including input from the National Data Library team from DSIT; and the [Data and AI public engagement community of practice](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-03-community-of-practice) second meeting. 

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
I’ve been inspired by the community data campaigns this week and how they’re mobilising to change the world. [Watch these “shorts”](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJHuxo3woL6IRCoB7qAASD2S_KH6zqQe&si=71jVXRm-Xg3y10aJ) on our YouTube channel to hear more. 

### What I’ve been reading
I watched the recording of the Institute for Government’s panel discussion on ‘[How Government should use AI](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/how-should-government-use-ai)’ which was really interesting. 

And I’ve been mulling over a [recent IPSOS report](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/people-are-uncomfortable-ai-replacing-human-judgement-high-stakes-decisions) that highlights how AI is bringing a new digital divide, how people see AI in specific contexts (rather than having a blanket for/against view).  In the article it says “This underscores the importance of building trust through transparent communication, robust regulatory frameworks, and demonstrable commitment to ethical AI practices”. At Connected by Data we’d suggest it underscores the new for public engagement, participation of those affected by AI being involved in its implementation and development. This builds trust as well as better outcomes for all too.
