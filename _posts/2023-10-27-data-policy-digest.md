# Data policy developments

## Deeply DPDIB

It will be Commons report stage (when MPs discuss [amendments](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications) suggested in committee stage) and then the Lords for DPDIB. Expect it some time after [the state opening on 7 November](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/stateopening/) (we hear rumours it could be at the end of November). A DCMS official suggested the Bill ‘[will not be adopted until around middle of 2024](https://twitter.com/LauraLinkomies/status/1709132212392636669)’.

One [proposed amendment](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0314/amend/datapro_rm_rep_0825.pdf) is on processing of data by the police - the Police Federation has more on [the campaign behind that](https://www.polfed.org/news/latest-news/2023/the-importance-of-getting-data-protection-laws-to-work-with-police-not-against-them/) - while the outgoing Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner has [expressed concern](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/retaining-the-biometrics-of-people-arrested-for-serious-offences/letter-to-hm-chief-inspector-andy-cooke-regarding-the-use-of-police-powers-to-retain-biometrics-for-those-arrested-for-serious-offences-accessible-ve) about a gap in monitoring the use of police powers to retain biometric data. 

A statutory instrument we flagged [last time out](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/09/29/data-policy-digest) (that changes references in law to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to the European Convention on Human Rights instead) has [been recommended](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/393/european-statutory-instruments-committee/news/197980/committee-recommends-data-protection-regulations-should-be-upgraded-to-affirmative-procedure/) for debate and approval by parliament (known as affirmative parliamentary procedure) by a parliamentary committee. Their recommendations aren't binding, but the government has accepted them every time so far.

And… DSIT has published the [Data Protection and Journalism Code of Practice 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/explanatory-memorandum-to-the-data-protection-and-journalism-code-of-practice-2023) … The Register looked at [what to expect when the UK-US Data Bridge comes into force](https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/11/uk_us_data_bridge/) this week… and government published an [evaluation of the International Data Transfer Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-international-data-transfer-agreement).


## Bills, bills, bills

**Online Safety Bill** [The Bill is now law](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-children-and-adults-to-be-safer-online-as-world-leading-bill-becomes-law), prompting reactions from organisations including [Glitch](https://glitchcharity.co.uk/online-safety-act/), [Carnegie UK](https://carnegieuktrust.org.uk/blog-posts/online-safety-and-carnegie-uk/), [Which?](https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/which-celebrates-new-online-safety-laws-ae9O50W9NGUk), [5Rights](https://5rightsfoundation.com/in-action/the-online-safety-act-has-reached-royal-assent-but-what-does-this-new-law-mean-for-children.html), and [ORG](https://twitter.com/OpenRightsGroup/status/1717564492001755163), and stories from outlets including [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67221691) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-uks-controversial-online-safety-act-is-now-law/). The Secretary of State also [discussed antisemitism and violence with social media companies](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/readout-of-technology-secretarys-meeting-with-social-media-companies-on-antisemitism-and-violence-online).

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** Like DPDIB, it’s Commons report stage next. The Digital Competition Expert Panel - who made the original recommendation for the Bill - are [unhappy about proposed changes](https://twitter.com/drphilipmarsden/status/1715702777932906658), saying they would upset the balance between the interests of big tech platforms and their users. The chair of the Lords digital committee is [similarly unimpressed](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41683/documents/206515/default/). As are newspapers including [the Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12606155/PM-giving-tech-giants-like-Google-Facebook-bid-avoid-paying-media-outlets-use-news.html) (their angle includes tech giants bidding ‘to avoid paying media outlets to use their news’, who could possibly have predicted etc), which also carries [criticism of big tech from former digital secretary, Nadine Dorries](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12663701/NADINE-DORRIES-Googled-learnt-Big-Tech.html). Meanwhile the CMA launched [a market investigation into cloud services](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-market-investigation-into-cloud-services). 


## AI got ‘rithm

ONLY FIVE SLEEPS UNTIL (FRONTIER) AI POLICY CHRISTMAS!

Most of us are on Santa Sunak’s naughty list, with only a select few making it to Bletchley Park for the AI Safety Summit on 1-2 November. [The programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-programme) has been published for those that will be there, alongside [a shiny Summit website](https://www.aisafetysummit.gov.uk/). Day 1 will be led by DSIT Secretary, Michelle Donelan, with discussions on ‘Understanding Frontier AI Risks’, ‘Improving Frontier AI Safety’, and ‘AI for good – AI for the next generation’. Your reminder that the UK government defines ‘frontier AI’, the focus of the Summit, as ‘[highly capable general-purpose AI models](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction/ai-safety-summit-introduction-html#scope-of-the-ai-safety-summit-what-is-frontier-ai) that can perform a wide variety of tasks and match or exceed the capabilities present in today’s most advanced models’. There’s a [blogpost](https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/makingsciencepublic/2023/10/20/frontier-ai-tracing-the-origin-of-a-concept/) from the University of Nottingham on the origins of the term.

Day 2 will see the PM convene ‘convene a small group of governments, companies and experts to further the discussion on what steps can be taken to address the risks in emerging AI technology and ensure it is used as a force for good’ as Donelan agrees next steps with international counterparts.

The four ‘road to the summit’ events have all happened, at [the Turing](https://twitter.com/turinginst/status/1712111067311092073), the [British Academy](https://twitter.com/JonathanCamrose/status/1712768495497224652), [techUK](https://twitter.com/techUK/status/1714286680017179129) and [the Royal Society](https://twitter.com/royalsociety/status/1717837677976867109). Michelle Donelan [answered questions on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michelledonelan_aisafetysummit-activity-7117904986692349952-Pmkf), while one of the PM’s representatives to the Summit, Matt Clifford, [answered questions on Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewclifford/status/1707423037128138856) (and [blogged](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattcliffordef_after-last-weeks-piece-on-ai-for-good-activity-7119713090849361920-WM9n) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7117097828664909824), as well as [podcasting](https://twitter.com/matthewclifford/status/1717802074396606852)).

### The Fringe
For those not heading to Bletchley, there are [lots of events at the AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/events) at the British Library (Monday to Friday) and elsewhere. On Tuesday, there’s [the AI and Society Forum](https://www.aisocietyforum.net/), where Jeni and I will be running a session on ‘Writing an alternative agenda for the AI Safety Summit’. The Citizens have a [‘People’s AI Summit’](https://the-citizens.com/campaign/peoples-ai-campaign/) going on.

**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** is also running a [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai), where twelve randomly selected, representative members of the public will attend, observe and discuss key events at the AI Fringe and produce a public report giving their verdict on AI and their recommendations to government, industry, civil society and academia for further action. You can hear their initial verdict [at an event on Friday](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-11-03-peoples-panel-on-ai-verdict), and [sign up for updates](https://connectedbydata.org/blog/2023/10/21/peoples-panel-update). 

### What will come out of the Summit
There’s been a lot of speculation about who is - and isn’t - going to be at Bletchley. I had [a freedom of information request delayed](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1716510659007951208), while Byline Times have criticised the lack of transparency. We know of some world leaders [who](https://www.ft.com/content/6a615c49-5bd9-4a81-8c31-cacbf3db1e2c) [will](https://www.ft.com/content/e0574e79-d723-4d94-9681-fae22648e3ad) and [won’t](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67118264) be going, but we’ll just have to wait until Wednesday.

And there’s been lots of speculation about what would be agreed. Politico [reported on the 3rd](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pitch-ai-safety-institute-rishi-sunak/) that the UK might create a new AI Safety Institute (perhaps evolving from the Frontier Model Taskforce)... The Guardian [reported on 10th](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/10/downing-street-trying-to-agree-statement-about-ai-risks-with-world-leaders) that the focus wasn’t on a single new institution… on a Politico podcast [on the 17th](https://www.politico.eu/article/michelle-donelan-global-ai-regulator/), Michelle Donelan dampened rumours that the Summit would lead to a new global regulator but did not deny the Frontier Taskforce could develop into an AI Safety Institute…  the FT [reported on the 19th](https://www.ft.com/content/700dd87c-d040-4215-9d1e-d36ba42c7655) that a global advisory group on AI (distinct from a planned UK AI safety institute) might come out of the Summit (and Politico that [China would be invited](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-set-to-invite-china-to-new-global-ai-research-body/) to be part of a global research body)… and then on the 26th Politico [parsed leaked communiques](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/and-now-for-some-ai-doom/) to detect a ‘blow’ to create a global research body.

Later that morning, [a speech from the PM](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023) laid out that the UK would establish ‘the world’s first AI Safety Institute’ and also proposed ‘a truly global expert panel, nominated by the countries and organisations attending, to publish a State of AI Science report’, taking inspiration from [the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/). There were also some funding commitments and recommitments on top of £37m [announced previously](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-projects-supporting-small-businesses-in-fashion-farming-and-fire-fighting-to-get-funding-boost-ahead-of-uk-ai-safety-summit). Sunak’s speech followed one earlier in the week [from Donelan](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/technology-secretary-michelle-donelans-speech-at-onward), and the publication of [a discussion paper on the capabilities and risks of frontier AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks-discussion-paper). The Government has since published a report on [safety policies from AI companies](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/leading-frontier-ai-companies-publish-safety-policie) and an [international survey of public opinion on AI safety](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-survey-of-public-opinion-on-ai-safety) (Ada have also just published [a review on what the public thinks about AI](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/evidence-review/what-do-the-public-think-about-ai/)). 

What are the prospects for success? [Politico thinks the odds](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-odds-are-against-rishi-sunak-ai-summit-might-just-pull-it-off/) - and ‘shambolic organisation’ - may be against the PM but he could yet pull off a diplomatic coup ([the FT also has an overview](https://www.ft.com/content/e0574e79-d723-4d94-9681-fae22648e3ad)). One of those with a golden ticket to Bletchley - Connor Leahy, chief exec of AI safety research company Conjecture - has said [the Summit risks achieving very little](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/20/rishi-sunak-global-ai-safety-summit-connor-leahy), with powerful tech companies capturing the agenda. He’s one of the people behind [a new ‘Control AI’ campaign](https://twitter.com/ai_ctrl) (who commissioned [some polling](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/voters-deepfakes-ban-ai-intelligent-humans-2708693) this week). The [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/10/02/britain-ai-summit-could-backfire/) ([twice](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/10/23/linkedins-consultant-class-captured-downing-street/)) worries about the same. And [‘Britain’s Big AI Summit Is a Doom-Obsessed Mess’](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/britains-ai-summit-doom-obsessed-mess) - tell us what you really think, eh Wired?

We’ll be holding **an open call online at 2pm on Tuesday 7 November** to reflect on all the Summit-related activity - [sign up if you'd like to come along](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0sdO6rrz0rHNGPBcht_dkc7_n9GHXo5qlR#/registration).

### Summit to use as a media hook
Naturally, many organisations have published reports or previews ahead of the Summit, including… [BCS](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/pm-should-make-ethics-a-priority-at-ai-safety-summit-say-tech-professionals/) (the PM should put ethics at the top of the Summit agenda)... [the RSS](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/10/25/evaluating-ai.html) (‘statistics and data science are at the heart of the AI movement’)... the [Minderoo Centre’s Gina Neff](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/ai-safety-summit-diary-the-lead-up/) (who will be keeping a summit diary)...

Onward, [TBI](https://www.institute.global/insights/public-services/as-the-uks-ai-safety-summit-approaches-governments-must-take-steps-to) and the Startup Coalition (with [a startup roadmap](https://api.startupcoalition.io/news/the-uks-ai-startup-roadmap/))... [IPPR](https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ai-for-public-value-creation) (on AI for public value creation and three policy pillars)...

There’s also been the [Godfathers](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18280665/ai-godfathers-turing-award-2018-yoshua-bengio-geoffrey-hinton-yann-lecun) part whatever-we’re-on-now, with Meta’s Yann LeCun saying [AI will never threaten humans](https://www.ft.com/content/30fa44a1-7623-499f-93b0-81e26e22f2a6) while Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio are among those being among the co-authors of a paper criticising some AI development as [‘utterly reckless’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/ai-firms-must-be-held-responsible-for-harm-they-cause-godfathers-of-technology-say). Elsewhere, Mustafa Suleyman and Eric Schmidt [called for an AI equivalent of the IPCC](https://www.ft.com/content/d84e91d0-ac74-4946-a21f-5f82eb4f1d2d) (Ada’s Andrew Strait is [less convinced](https://twitter.com/agstrait/status/1714970119795827130)), Demis Hassabis said AI risk must be [treated as seriously as climate crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/ai-risk-climate-crisis-google-deepmind-chief-demis-hassabis-regulation), and the Guardian looked at the divides between (exclusively male) [AI pioneers](https://theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/hope-or-horror-the-great-ai-debate-dividing-its-pioneers). They also ran a useful piece on [‘a day in the life of AI’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2023/oct/25/a-day-in-the-life-of-ai). 

And on a lighter note… DSIT used AI to [generate 1990s yearbook-style photos of its leadership team](https://twitter.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1712721134712475944), and like some predictive supercomputer I already know which two are your favourites.

### Let’s talk about summit else
Rattling through everything else… The chief secretary to the Treasury [held a roundtable](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chief-secretary-hosts-ai-meeting-to-boost-public-sector-productivity) with ‘AI experts’ on driving public sector productivity (some of them visible [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnGlenUK/status/1712084252303519857))...

## DSIT up and take notice

Continuing with AI… an independent report [praised the UK’s AI Standards Hub](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-report-finds-uk-leads-the-way-with-ai-standards-hub) … the Frontier AI Taskforce has brought in [‘leading technical organisations’ to help research risks](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/frontier-ai-taskforcebrings-in-leading-technical-organisations-to-research-risks) … there’s [a new innovation challenge around tackling bias](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-innovation-challenge-launched-to-tackle-bias-in-ai-systems) in AI systems (the dedicated website describes CDEI as a directorate of DSIT, for those studying the finer details of CDEI’s institutional form - we know you’re out there)… and (I think I missed this last time) CDEI have published [some research on public perceptions towards the use of foundation models in the public sector](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-perceptions-towards-the-use-of-foundation-models-in-the-public-sector) (the public are open to their use, but want human accountability). 

In non-AI news (such a thing exists?), DSIT has published [an outcomes monitoring framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-regulation-driving-growth-and-unlocking-innovation) for the Plan for Digital Regulation. The Geospatial Commission has [a new interim director](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-interim-director-appointed-to-the-geospatial-commission), and [a new report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finding-the-way-forward-location-data-to-enable-connected-and-automated-mobility) highlighting [the power of location data](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/location-data-can-help-deliver-the-safe-rollout-of-autonomous-vehicles) in the safe deployment of connected and self-driving road vehicles.

Policing minister generated controversy at party conference when he suggested the [UK’s passport database could be used to help catch criminals](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/02/uk-passport-images-database-could-be-used-to-catch-shoplifters) - other politicians and campaign groups reacted by [calling for a ban on facial recognition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67022005) (and in the [interview linked above](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/ai-minister-interview-tech-bro), AI minister Viscount Camrose thinks there are some use cases facial recognition shouldn’t be anywhere near).

Over at the Cabinet Office… deputy prime minister [Oliver Dowden told the Future Investment Initiative](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/deputy-prime-minister-oliver-dowdens-speech-to-the-future-investment-initiative-24-october-2023) (aka [‘Davos in the desert’](https://www.ft.com/content/c233373f-f937-421f-89b9-734110709fee)) that the next big global shock could be a ‘tech shock’ that could make what we’ve seen so far look like ‘relative skirmishes’... minister for the Cabinet Office Jeremy Quin [gave a speech](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/09/27/government-and-politics/cabinet-office-minister-i-want-to-rebuild-the-system-to-unlock-transformation/) about digital transformation as government said it [would recruit 2,500 ‘ambitious tech talents’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-steps-up-digital-skills-with-2500-new-tech-recruits) to digital roles bu June 2025… and another Jeremy, Chancellor Hunt [‘suggested that AI could be used](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jeremy-hunt-benefits-welfare-reform-public-services-costs-rising-taxes-h3jdr2njq) by teachers to mark papers, by police officers to prevent crimes and by doctors and nurses to diagnose illnesses’. 


## Conference calls

It’s now been a few weeks since the end of party conference season; my body has sufficiently adjusted to processing less alcohol, more normal hours and having access to salad again. 

If you weren’t able to make it to Manchester/Liverpool/Bournemouth/Brighton or elsewhere, it’s worth checking [our full listing of data and AI events](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/09/29/data-policy-digest) to see which ones have been recorded (the IfG panel discussions I chaired on AI at [Conservatives](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/ifg-conservative-party-conference-2023) and [Labour](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/ifg-labour-party-conference-2023) were, for example). 

At Conservative conference, [Rishi Sunak’s speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya7INY7R9rU) touched on the importance of innovation but will be best remembered for HS2 rather than anything on data and AI; [Michelle Donelan’s](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/michelle-donelan-2023-speech-to-conservative-party-conference/) ran through what DSIT has done since its creation but it was the depoliticising woke science section which garnered the headlines. I also caught Cabinet Office minister, Alex Burghart, talking about [some pilots of generative AI inside government](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZBEQkI-idOA?si=MWGkdSODIvJVwZOv&t=980). 

At Green conference, we held a great event with former leader, Natalie Bennett, and Andy Stirling, professor of science and tech policy at the University of Sussex. You can [catch up on our live tweets](https://twitter.com/ConnectedByData/status/1710692786515657114) while you await a full write up. The conference passed [a motion on AI](https://www.greencoordinate.co.uk/archive/autumn2023/motions/policy-on-artificial-intelligence/), saying [good governance rather than prevention should be the aim](https://www.greencoordinate.co.uk/archive/autumn2023/motions/policy-on-artificial-intelligence/).

At Labour conference, we held a discussion with the Fabian Society and a brilliant panel, including shadow AI minister Matt Rodda MP, to launch our [‘progressive vision’](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision) which has contributions from across civil society. Both the event and the pamphlet are full of ideas for what a Labour government should think about and do around data and AI. Again, [catch up on the live tweets](https://twitter.com/ConnectedByData/status/1711419870535897591) - a full write up will follow.

Elsewhere at Labour conference… [a motion on AI and technology in the workplace](https://labourlist.org/2023/10/labour-conference-2023-motions-debate-votes-delegates/) from the Unite and CWU unions passed… new shadow DSIT secretary Peter Kyle [trailed](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/24329382/scale-of-jobless-brits-is-horrible-painful-toll/?s=03) and [delivered](https://policymogul.com/key-updates/31440/peter-kyle-s-speech-at-labour-conference) his first speech in post… Keir Starmer touched on technology and the economy, and for health, [in his speech](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmers-speech-at-labour-conference/) … [an apparent deepfake of Starmer](https://fullfact.org/news/keir-starmer-audio-swearing/) was [widely condemned](https://twitter.com/SimonClarkeMP/status/1710979175589290434), with [one shadow minister worried](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/london-playbook-pm-sunak-calls-in-cobra/) about how resources like Hansard could make future fakes easier and [a suggestion of legislation](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-considers-new-laws-ai-31191047) to tackle the problem … [policy announcements](https://twitter.com/LabourList/status/1712089217692467354) included money for health tech and more certain R&D funding… and in general, [Politico thought pro-innovation frontbench messages](https://www.politico.eu/article/friend-or-foe-labour-party-keir-starmer-looming-battle-ai-artificial-intelligence/) might cause problems with the unions.


## Parly-vous data?

What’s the collective noun for a group of regulators? Because one of those - consisting of Ofcom, the ICO, the CMA, the FCA and the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum - was up in front of the Science, Innovation and Technology select committee yesterday [discussing AI governance](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6986/governance-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/). Ofcom’s Melanie Dawes is also one of those appearing before the Public Accounts Committee [talking online safety regulation today](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/19280/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/).

POST, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, is [looking for contributions](https://post.parliament.uk/approved-work-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education-delivery-and-assessment/) to its new note on ‘use of artificial intelligence in education delivery and assessment’ until the end of November.

Over in the Lords, the Communications and Digital Committee has been [taking evidence on large language models](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/170/communications-and-digital-committee/events/) and was [unimpressed by the government response to its report on digital exclusion](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/10/23/society-and-welfare/not-good-enough-government-declines-to-create-new-digital-exclusion-unit-and-strategy/), while in the Chamber there was [a discussion of AI](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-10-24/debates/86A5DE73-DF1D-4E65-B18F-B2750DDC7261/Debate) the importance of public engagement - and metaphorical sandwiches. 


## Labour movement

Most of these are covered in our ‘Conference call’ section, above, including [our new pamphlet (and longer doc) on what a progressive vision for data and AI policy could look like](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision).

Elsewhere, [LabourList summarised the policy outputs](https://labourlist.org/2023/10/labour-national-policy-forum-final-document-summary-policy-manifesto-party-conference/) from the National Policy Forum… the Telegraph doesn’t think [mooted proposed legislation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/21/starmers-new-labour-style-plan-to-roll-out-legislation/) from any incoming Labour government will focus on data/digital… and ‘[cutting red tape to speed up the adoption of new artificial intelligence](https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/healthcare/nhs/2023/10/labour-government-nhs-health-service-wes-streeting-preet-gill-andrew-gwynne), which can rapidly read scans and interpret X-rays’ is part of the plan for reforming the health service.

* Once more unto data breaches, with [23andMe User Data Stolen in Targeted Attack on Ashkenazi Jews](https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/), a privacy issue with New York’s transit authority potentially exposing [‘Months Worth of Trip Histories to Stalkers’](https://www.404media.co/mta-disables-another-privacy-invading-feature-after-404-media-investigation/), and the ICO warning that [‘BCC emails remain public sector data-protection blind spot’](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/bcc-emails-remain-public-sector-dataprotection-blind-spot-ico-warns)
* Sticking with the ICO… they called for bosses to respect staff’s right to privacy if they wish to keep tabs on them at work as [one in five UK adults said they thought they’d been monitored](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/02/uk-adults-monitored-by-employer-workplace-surveillance) by an employer… launched [a consultation on draft Data Protection Fining Guidance](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/ico-and-stakeholder-consultations/ico-consultation-on-draft-data-protection-fining-guidance/) … and found the former boss of NatWest bank [breached Nigel Farage’s privacy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67222543)

* And the CEO of Europe’s largest tech conference [resigned over Israel-Hamas comments](https://www.politico.eu/article/paddy-cosgrave-web-summit-ceo-europe-tech-conference-resign-israel-hamas-comment/). 


# What we’ve been up to

* We’ve been planning lots of [Connected Conversations](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-connected-conversations), with one already done on [collective data rights](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-09-27-connected-conversation-collective-data-rights) (do we need them and what should they look like?), and others to come on [open government](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-11-29-open-government-data-ai-governance) and data and AI; the potential, and practicalities, of [norm entrepreneurship](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-11-13-data-governance-norms) for better data governance; and [deliberative governance](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-11-22-deliberative-governance-data-and-ai)

* Did we mention our [progressive vision for data and AI policy](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision)?


# What everyone else has been up to

* The Ada Lovelace Institute published [an evidence review on the use of foundation models in the public sector](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/evidence-review/foundation-models-public-sector/) (with a [shorter policy briefing](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/policy-briefing/foundation-models-public-sector/) alongside)
* The Civic AI Observatory published [their first newsletter](https://civicai.uk/p/issue-1-organisational-policies) which includes, among other things, some links to organisational policies on AI (I’ve also spotted policies from [Demos](https://demos.co.uk/generative-ai-policy-paper/) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/articles/2023/generative-ai-at-the-bbc)) 
* Rootcause have studied various frames in the public discourse around AI and concluded that ‘progressive organisations working on AI and digital rights need to move the public conversation about new technologies [towards the values we want to underpin digital societies](https://rootcause.global/framing-ai/) and away from a technical focus on risk mitigation and regulation’
* The Worker Info Exchange have had [further success in court](https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/post/uber-ordered-to-pay-584-000-for-failure-to-comply-with-court-order-in-robo-firing-case), with the District Court of Amsterdam ruling that Uber failed to comply with an order to provide transparency into the automated decision to dismiss two drivers from the UK and Portugal.

* Understanding Patient Data have [updated the content on their website](https://twitter.com/Patient_Data/status/1716711187893895510) including a guide to how patient data is used. The King’s Fund, meanwhile, asked [if the NHS can manage without AI](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2023/09/can-nhs-manage-without-ai)
* Which? asked: [Are AI chatbots risking a new wave of convincing scams?](https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/are-ai-chatbots-risking-a-new-wave-of-convincing-scams-aAsqP2V6I0pE)
