### What I’ve been doing
August is a quieter month in terms of meetings, with team members and partner organisations taking leave.  We had a Reading Week too which intentionally drops all internal / project management meetings to give people space for catching up - and ideally some actual reading too.

I had a few days off for holiday with my family in a festival field.  It came with an enforced digital detox as there was no phone signal, let alone data.  Although a large group of teenagers managed to find a very precise spot (after some very tenacious hunting) almost pressed up against the portaloos and decided to situate themselves there for the duration of the festival. I wasn’t that desperate!

When I returned I knew that I had also decided to leave X (personally). I [wrote a breakup letter](https://emilyjmacaulay.wordpress.com/2024/08/14/my-breakup-letter-to-x/) to help work my thinking through, posted it, and haven’t looked back.  The loss has been helped by a real uplift in Bluesky over the same time - and there’s some real old-school Twitter vibes on there. [I’m here on there](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjmacaulay.bsky.social) if you’re interested and [here’s my Linktr.ee](Linktr.ee) for everywhere else.

I’m off next week too, so this week has been trying to clear weekly actions for two weeks and ensure we’re ready for the start of September.

### What I need to take care of
My final bookkeeping exam this afternoon. Getting those nerves kicking in again though I feel like the revision I’ve done it solid. It’s the unknown - and the fact the result matters - that causes the worry.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
There was a lot of talk and reflections by people ahead of my decision to leave X finally.  This was [an impactful post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229213044881399808/) from a voice I respect and value, Shereen Daniels.

### What I’ve been reading
August has contained a flurry of reading for pleasure. I’ve finished ‘[Ten things I hate about me: How to stay alive with a brain that’s trying to kill you](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/joe-tracini/ten-things-i-hate-about-me/9781398705937/)’ by Joe Tracini; ‘[Essex Girls: For profane and opinionated women everywhere](https://serpentstail.com/work/essex-girls/)’ by Sarah Perry; and am now deep into ‘[Fearless: Adventures with extraordinary women](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/fearless-9781399401197/)’ by Louise Minchin. I’ve enjoyed it all.
