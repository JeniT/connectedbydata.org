So this was my first week (and a little bit) as the new Advocacy and Campaigns Director at **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**, it’s also my first set of weeknotes. Writing a weekly reflection on what’s gone on is relatively new to me, and then publishing it for all to read is completely new, so I’m just (slightly trepidatiously) working out how to best use it. Jeni was clear, it’s a very open thing and not to worry, so I’m going to go with that and see what happens!

## Meeting the team

The highlight of the week was actually meeting Tim and Jeni in person at our first strategy day together. As I’d only met them both online, even during the interview process, this was such a great thing to do, putting some flesh and blood to their pixel forms. It was also a little nerve wracking as it was actually only Day 3 and I had to run two sessions on ‘our people’ and ‘our story’ (which ended up as one with a bit of collective in-flight reprioritisation)

One of Jeni’s main aims was to use the day to start our team building, and talking through who we are, how we work and our collective values was massively useful and already felt incredibly open and supportive and aligned – surely a good sign of things to come! I also appreciated Tim and Jeni candidness about their own strengths and weaknesses which made it much easier for me, as the very newest, to do the same.


## Our people  

The one exercise I ended up having to lead, coming after discussing Jeni’s initial proposed theory of change, was looking at _Our People_: those who need change; those we want to influence; those we want to work with.

These were key questions we’d spent a lot of time on at Shelter, where I worked previously, particularly from a community organising perspective. It asks who it is we are here to servee, what are the problems they face and how to drive change with them.

For Tim, Jeni and I, it prompted some interesting debate, especially on how we bring the people, injustice and emotion to the heart of the work we do and from that build the core story we want to tell about the need for collective community governance of big data and AI. Really adding the ‘who and why’ to the ‘how’.

We also began an interesting discussion on who has the power to make change, whether that’s a focus on changing practice within existing structures of power policy and resource allocation or whether that’s actually shifting those structures. Plus what role **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** should play in this, particularly as generous strategists, connectors and conveners.  It very much felt like a beginning with lots to do - but totally fascinating to be diving in!

## What the public think

As part of the day, Aidan from the Ada Lovelace Institute came and gave a great overview of his work around public understanding and attitudes to data and AI. What particularly struck me is how you can’t really separate the public’s attitude to the ‘tech’ from the institution - for example (as I understood it) trust in the NHS and tech/data sharing is high because people see the NHS about delivering collective good and trust diminishes as their perception of the collective good diminishes. It was interesting to reflect on what that means and if you need to think about how institutions (government, civil society and corporate) are governed in the future as much as the data.

## Data newbie

Finally as I’m new to the ‘data world’ please be patient. It’s absolutely fascinating: I’ve been consumed by a great starter reading list Jeni sent me (happy to share) and working though what’s on the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** web site, but I know I’ve got a lot to learn. Although that does give me that lovely permission to ask some very basic questions with innocence and impunity… at least for now.
