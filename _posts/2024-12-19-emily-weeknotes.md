### What I’ve been doing
I’m slightly limping to the end of 2024 having been hit with suspected COVID over the last week but as today is my last day working until January, I appear to be recovering and it has been good to clear some tasks that have been hanging around a little including monthly reconciliation and some social media scheduling.

It was a while ago now but recently I had to complete the W8BEN-E form for some US related work. It is a fairly baffling form but I found [this YouTube video](https://www.ihatenumbers.co.uk/how-to-complete-the-w-8ben-e-form/) invaluable and highly recommend it to anyone having to wrangle one.

At the end of November I got married. It was a wonderful day full of joy and love, and honestly I’m still in a bit of a love bubble with it. [There’s some photos on Insta here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDCmtT4ifGz/?img_index=1). 

### What I need to take care of
Nothing now, I’m signing off. But 2025 starts with four events that need planning (different scales) - all taking place in the first four weeks and some budget forecasting too.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
Possibly as a result of getting married, and of being poorly, I’m a little more weepy than usual. [This advert for a hardware shop](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDAUi_NPVyS/?igsh=YjkxeDB3M24yNm5j) in Ireland hit me hard in the feels! (I know!)

### What I’ve been reading
I’ve recently started [‘More Perfect’ by Temi Oh](https://www.awesomebooks.com/book/9781471171314/more-perfect/used) - described as “The Circle meets inception, a story of tech and connection’. I’m enjoying it so far and suspect I’ll be recommending it too.
