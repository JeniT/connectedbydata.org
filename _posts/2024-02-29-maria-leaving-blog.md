It has been almost 18 months since I first joined CbD, and it is crazy to look back and see there was a whole different scenario going on around data and AI.

I remember coming across Tim’s tweet advertising the Research Associate position and deciding to send an application without any expectation of ever hearing back. What really excited me about the job was finally being able to combine the two topics that have guided my academic curiosity since my first year in college: participation and data.

It might be hard to remember a time before ChatGPT, but back then, conversations about participatory decision-making in AI were not happening yet, and the ones around participation and technology more broadly were still incipient. In Brasil the agenda around collective data rights was starting to take shape through the lens of collective redress, with cases such as the [ViaQuatro](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/data-for-sale-in-brazil/) hitting the public debate.

Since then, AI (and participatory AI) has taken the centre of the public debate. And CbD has exposed me to these conversations and provided me with institutional support to reflect on them.

## Bringing participation and inclusion to the table
With most of the big tech corporations being from the U.S., calls for participation and inclusion aiming to challenge their opaque decision-making are very much needed. And watching these unfold in the past year has been incredibly encouraging and enlightening.

I do, however, think it poses some questions about who the current narratives of inclusion truly serve, and the fact that the Majority World is so unequally positioned that most of these efforts are being led by U.S. and European-based organisations.

One example comes to mind. Last year I went to an international conference around data justice where participants from NYU presented some research results authored by a Brazilian think-tank. As important as it was to have that data being discussed and authors from the Majority World being acknowledged, it does shed light on the fact that said Brazilian organisation was not able to attend due to lack of funding and no remote participation option was offered.

So, I would like to see a scenario in which voices from outside the U.S. and Europe are not seen as intrinsically “diverse voices.”

## Narratives and communication
I am amazed by the traction the name “artificial intelligence” has gained, despite the fact that it does not say anything about what these technologies are or do.

This past year I have been reflecting a lot about how the knowledge gap between technologists and citizens seems to be part of a broader political project. Exploring this gap with the use of buzzwords helps to push techno-solutionism narratives, and steers attention away from what technology really does, good and bad.

I think bridging that gap is essential to holding companies accountable and creating inclusive and collective decision-making processes. And researchers and academics should take part in expanding evidence-informed conversations.

Over the past months, thinking about the participatory governance game and the speculative fiction story, along with witnessing Tim’s facilitation abilities, has broadened my perspective on how research outputs and contributions to the field could be.


## Collaboration and kindness
One of my favourite learnings from improv has been to collaborate: how to make your partners shine at the best of their abilities, and know when to take the spotlight and when to give it to someone else. 

In face of such power imbalances and a topic that is as rapidly changing as technology, collaboration and combined efforts are particularly necessary. Unfortunately, sometimes ego, and institutional ego, can get in the way.

It has been refreshing and encouraging to learn that there are ways to collaborate in the fight for just technology, prioritising kindness and humanity - through engagement, Connected Conversations and Emily’s thoughtfulness in welcoming participants to the People’s Panel. I will always be grateful to CbD for showing me that.

## Leaving-ish
I am incredibly lucky to have had the privilege to work with Tim, Emily, Obioma, Jeni,  Jonathan, Helena, Adam and Gavin. Working at CbD has definitely been a turning point in my professional trajectory.

As I leave the position of Research Associate, I look forward to continuing exchanging ideas and learning from them as a Fellow.
