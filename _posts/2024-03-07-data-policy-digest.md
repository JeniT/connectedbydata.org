Hello, and welcome to our fourteenth Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. The Budget, national insurance cuts, tax cuts, and a possible May election are just some of the topics dominating the political fiscal discourse and doubling as an SEO-friendly introduction to this fortnight’s newsletter, a blockbuster on a par with anything at this weekend’s Oscars and with more political intrigue than Super Tuesday or a day in the life of Christian Horner at Red Bull. If that doesn’t game Google, nothing will.

## Data policy developments

### Deeply DPDIB

As we thought [last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/02/21/data-policy-digest), the Bill will start its journey through Lords grand committee [on 20 March](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/18402). Woo, and indeed, hoo.

Lots of amendments - [84 pages’ worth as of 1 March](https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/53585/documents/4517) - continue to go down (a reminder that only those agreed unanimously will be added in grand committee - the rest will have to wait for report stage). 

Those include several on algorithmic transparency reporting. A [parliamentary question](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-02-19/14646/) gives a little more detail on the government’s recent pledge (in its response to the AI white paper consultation) to make this mandatory - Public Technology [has a summary](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/02/27/science-technology-and-research/government-to-announce-plan-for-mandatory-transparency-for-departments-algorithms). Government also appears to have [a new format](https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records) for the few records so far published. Our friends over at the Public Law Project have a [longer list and a longstanding interest](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/the-tracking-automated-government-register/) in this area.

Meanwhile, [Big Brother Watch led more than 40 organisations](https://twitter.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1764707820165828654) (including Connected by Data) in ‘demanding the Government scrap new plans to monitor the bank accounts of millions’, as part of clauses added at the last moment [in the Commons](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/12/12/dpdib-commons-third-reading) and generating widespread controversy, including [in the Lords](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-lords-2nd-reading-summary). The Guardian has [a write-up](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/ministers-urged-to-scrap-plans-for-surveillance-of-benefit-claimants-bank-accounts).

In other news… Sky News has looked at the implications of DPDIB for the use of data in elections, with [Voters braced for Facebook and Instagram messages as political ad spend rises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5QREef4PhI)… [President Biden Issues Executive Order to Protect Americans’ Sensitive Personal Data](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-sweeping-executive-order-to-protect-americans-sensitive-personal-data/) (White House)… [Concerns raised over UK Data Protection Bill’s impact on EU’s GDPR](https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-privacy/news/concerns-raised-over-uk-data-protection-bills-impact-on-eus-gdpr/) (Euractiv)... James O’Malley has written for PoliticsHome about [the National Underground Asset Register](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/pipe-dreams-making-sense-ground-beneath-feet), which also features in the Bill (the government [has a page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-underground-asset-register-nuar) on it too)... and we’re interested to see the MoJ announces a [‘New law to make justice more accessible for innocent people wronged by powerful companies’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-make-justice-more-accessible-for-innocent-people-wronged-by-powerful-companies), given many of us would like to see collective rights in DPDIB - that’s actually one area we raise in our [brand new briefing](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-lords-committee-briefing) on the Bill for Lords committee stage. 

We’ve also written up [our recent civil society workshop, ‘Datafied’](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-02-13-cso-workshop), which highlighted many concerns about the Bill while discussing data and AI policy more widely.


### Bills, bills, bills

**Online Safety Act** The BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg continues a focus on online safety, [this week interviewing Mariano Janin](https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1764233191852810246), father of Mia Janin who took her own life after being bullied… Esther Ghey, mother of Brianna, [met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/02/29/mother-of-brianna-ghey-has-positive-meeting-rishi-sunak/)… [Banning phones in schools is just another ploy to distract us](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/03/eva-wiseman-banning-phones-in-schools-is-just-another-plot-to-distract-us), says Eva Wiseman in The Observer... Ofcom’s former head of online safety has [decided to step down](https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/1763588016432357540) after controversy over some social media posts… Ofcom has made a positive start but still has a lot of work to do on the online safety regime, says the [Public Accounts Committee](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmpubacc/73/summary.html)… while the OSA could pose some challenges to the development of quantum technologies, [according to the Regulatory Horizons Council](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-horizons-council-regulating-quantum-technology-applications) (h/t to the eagle-eyed Politico team).

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** [Report Stage kicks off on 11 March](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages/18513) in the Lords.

**Other** The Media Bill [awaits a date](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3505/stages) for Lords committee stage, though [Ofcom has published a roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv-radio-and-on-demand/information-for-industry/media-bill-roadmap-to-regulation) for how it would regulate based on the Bill… it’s Commons committee next for the [Automated Vehicles Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3506)… the [Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508/stages/18515), which [several civil society organisations are concerned about](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/publications/joint-briefing-on-the-investigatory-powers-amendment-bill/), starts Commons committee stage today, with [several amendments down](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-04/0157/amend/invest_power_day_pbc_0307.pdf)… and in the EU, ‘As of today, big platforms designed as “gatekeepers” [must comply](https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1765634305722556890) with precise obligations — or face heavy sanctions’ under the Digital Markets Act.


### AI got ‘rithm

Remember the AI Safety Summit last November? [Remember all the other spin-off and fringe events it prompted?](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/11/16/data-policy-digest) Well the organisers of the Fringe have just published [Perspectives from the AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/#perspectives), said perspectives coming from a range of organisations across civil society, industry and academia that were involved. It also features [our People’s Panel](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai). We should be approaching the virtual South Korean follow-on summit soon, with the next in-person event - later this year or perhaps early 2025 - in France.

In other UK AI news… note the spring date on [the NAO’s forthcoming report on the use of AI in government](https://www.nao.org.uk/work-in-progress/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-government/)… law firm Lewis Silkin have looked at [the government’s AI white paper response through a work lens](https://www.lewissilkin.com/en/insights/white-paper-consultation-response-harnessing-the-ai-revolution)… and Politico spotted that the timeline for an expected CMA update on [the AI Foundation Models: initial review](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/ai-foundation-models-initial-review) has slipped a bit.

### Let’s get fis-cal, fis-cal

The government’s polling situation is dire - might a fiscal event… budge it?

There was [lots of pre-briefing](https://twitter.com/Gilesyb/status/1765335994268536959) about the likely data/AI-related announcements, including from government itself… [£1.8 billion benefits through public sector productivity drive](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/18-billion-benefits-through-public-sector-productivity-drive) (HMT) and [‘£360 million to boost British manufacturing and R&D’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/360-million-to-boost-british-manufacturing-and-rd) (DSIT)… [AI and drones in £800m Budget technology package](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68459210) (BBC)... [Budget: Funding for AI and DWP service modernisation in public sector productivity drive](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/spring-budget-2024-public-sector-productivity-drive-ai-dwp-service-modernisation-funding) (CSW)... [Britain’s AI sector expected to get £100m extra funding in budget](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/04/britain-ai-industry-funding-budget-alan-turing-institute) (The Guardian)... that all came around deputy PM [Oliver Dowden’s speech on AI for public good](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/deputy-prime-minister-speech-on-ai-for-public-good) (‘AI is potentially - and I don’t say this lightly - a “silver bullet”’), prompting stories like [UK government to trial ‘red box’ AI tools to improve ministerial efficiency](https://www.ft.com/content/f2ae55bf-b9fa-49b5-ac0e-8b7411729539) (FT)...

Here’s what a quick glance through the budget bumf turned up… in [his speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spring-budget-2024-speech), the Chancellor said he would fund the NHS productivity plan in full, which includes digital transformation ranging from using AI ‘to cut down and potentially cut in half form filling by doctors’, electronic patient records in all hospitals and improving the NHS app (the main document has [more](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=36), including an acceleration of the Federated Data Platform)... a [Centre for Police Productivity](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=39) will help ‘improve police data quality and enable forces to implement promising technologies’ including [facial recognition](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=72)… [support for Open Referral UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=41) and their data standard, for better information about community services… asking local authorities for their plans on [utilising data and technology](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=42)… [£100m over five years](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=65) for the Alan Turing Institute… [AI document processing](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=73), digitising prison services and jury bundles and introducing an offender risk management tool ‘to provide more robust, data-driven decisions’... outlining how [public compute](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=86) facilities will be accessed, a £7.4 million AI Upskilling Fund pilot for SMEs, and ‘two new data pilots to drive high quality AI in education and improve access to data in adult social care for a total of £3.5 million’... ‘making greater use of cutting-edge technology, [such as AI](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=40), across the public sector’, including more than doubling the size of [i.AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/incubator-for-artificial-intelligence) and deploying AI to combat fraud, and [a strategic vision](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=41) for the use of AI in the public sector… and accelerating [smart data schemes in energy and transport](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e8578eb559930011ade2cb/E03057752_HMT_Spring_Budget_Mar_24_Web_Accessible__2_.pdf#page=82) through targeted funding for consultations and calls for evidence…

Ada were quick out of the blocks with a response: while welcoming further investment, they say ‘there must be [more transparency](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/press-release/spring-budget-2024-ai/) around the proposed pilots, urgent progress on governance, and assurance that the views of frontline professionals and the public will be centred throughout’. Health data expert Jess Morley has [a thread on the health bits](https://twitter.com/jessRmorley/status/1765639467082129910), while [techUK have a useful summary](https://www.techuk.org/resource/the-spring-budget-2024-what-was-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-the-tech-sector.html) too. 

And remember that Budgets tend to unravel in the days afterwards as people have the time to comb through the detail (in the [Treasury documentation](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/spring-budget-2024), [OBR analysis](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-march-2024/) and elsewhere), so keep an eye out for further reaction and reflection.


### DSIT up and take notice
