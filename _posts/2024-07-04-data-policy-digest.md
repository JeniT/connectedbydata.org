Hello, and welcome to our 21st Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. 

I’m sure you don’t need to be reminded, but today is a very special day.

<!--more-->

Yes, it’s Independence Day! Best wishes to any readers in the US, where the Supreme Court has decided to mark the occasion by enabling a reenactment of the reign of [King George III](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c51yx1n15y4o).

And of course, here in the UK, it’s election day! Make sure you take the time to vote, whoever it is you’re voting for. 

Reporting restrictions are in place so there’s no news about the election until polls close - how will you fill the time before 10pm? You could [listen to the BBC’s Arthur election theme on loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVaI3vq68vY), or [listen to how they remixed it for tonight](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0j79rgw). You could scroll through [#dogsatpollingstations](https://x.com/hashtag/dogsatpollingstations?src=hashtag_click).

Or you could, you know, get stuck into all the links below.

If you work on or are interested in [how government should engage the public on data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), then you should sign up to the first event of our new community of practice on 18 July with some ace speakers. More details on [the sign up page](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-community-of-practice), and below.

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**. We’re on Twitter @ConnectedByData and @DataReform. You can also **[catch up on previous Digests](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-data-policy-digest)**.

## **Data policy developments** {#data-policy-developments}

### **Never mind the ballots** {#ballots}
If you’ve not already bookmarked it/made it your homepage/pledged to vote for it on 4 July, we’ve set up **[a Data and AI Civil Society Network Election Hub](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/data-ai-civil-society-election-hub)**. We’ll be updating with resources throughout the campaign - and you can add to it, too! (And if you’d like to find out more about the network, visit our **[dedicated website](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/)**.)

### **Manifesto destiny** {#manifesto}
[Digital election: party manifestos assessed](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/commentary-and-opinion/digital-election-party-manifestos-assessed/5120167.article) (Law Society Gazette, which includes a reference to [Count Binface’s manifesto](https://www.countbinface.com/manifesto) - there are a few tech-related pledges)... 

[techUK co-signs a letter urging the next government to modernise the UK’s data protection framework](https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-co-signs-a-letter-urging-the-next-government-to-modernise-the-uk-s-data-protection-framework.html) (techUK and others)… [Open Letter to political parties: Recommit to moving forward with Digital Verification in the UK](https://www.techuk.org/resource/open-letter-to-political-parties-recommit-to-moving-forward-with-digital-verification-in-the-uk.html) (techUK and others)... [Startup Manifesto 2024 - an Open Letter](https://www.startupmanifesto.co.uk/) (Startup Coalition)... [The Open Manifesto 2024](https://openuk.uk/openmanifesto/) - released a few months back but with a [big](https://openuk.uk/event-calendar/openuk-state-of-open-the-uk-in-2024-report-launch-day/) [launch day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTa0Z7jfFc) yesterday (OpenUK)...

### **Events, dear boy, events** {#what-happens-next}
So what happens tonight - and what happens next?

**2200** The exit poll drops as polls close… **2330** The [first results are expected](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/estimated-declaration-times-general-election-145455094.html) from the North East… 

And into Friday, in terms of data/AI-related frontbenchers… **0115** Chi Onwurah (Lab, Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West)... **0145** Jon Ashworth (Lab, Leicester South)... **0230** Chris Evans (Lab, Caerphilly)... some chap called Keir Starmer (Lab, Holborn and St Pancras)... **0300** Saqib Bhatti (Con, Meriden and Solihull East)... Chris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda and Ogmore)... Alex Davies-Jones (Lab, Pontypridd)... Matt Rodda (Lab, Reading Central)... **0315** Ed Davey (Lib Dem, Kingston and Surbiton)... Thangham Debbonaire (Lab) faces a tough battle with Carla Denyer (Green co-leader, Bristol Central)... **0330** Pat McFadden (Lab, Wolverhampton South East)... **0345** Oliver Dowden (Con, Hertsmere)... Darren Jones (Lab, Bristol North West)... **0400** John Glen (Con, Salisbury)... one Rishi Sunak (Con, Richmond and Northallerton)... DSIT Sec of State Michelle Donelan (Con, Melksham and Devizes)... Julia Lopez (Con, Hornchurch and Upminster)... **0430** Alex Burghart (Brentwood and Ongar)... **0445** shadow DSIT Sec, Peter Kyle (Lab, Hove and Portslade)... **0500** Daisy Cooper (Lib Dem, St Albans)... Lucy Frazer (Con, Ely and East Cambridgeshire)... **0530** Andrew Griffith (Con, Arundel and South Downs)... **0600** Layla Moran (Lib Dem, Oxford West and Abingdon).

Someone holding a relevant brief now is no guarantee they will hold the same brief if they’re in government post-election. Politico reports that Labour shadows are expected to stay in post should they win - the Guardian notes [Starmer’s commitment to greater ministerial stability](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/jul/02/uk-general-election-2024-tories-labour-polls?page=with:block-66841c9c8f08b8c654ee3363#block-66841c9c8f08b8c654ee3363) this parliament - though Labour’s frontbench is currently bigger than the ministerial maximum, and should shadow DCMS Sec, Thangam Debbonaire, lose her seat, there would be some movement. 

If the result is clear, one would [expect the new PM to go to the Palace](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/new-prime-minister-first-72-hours-general-election) and then go to speak on the steps (I mean, it’s never on the steps is it? It’s in the middle of the road, insert your own centrist joke should you wish) of Downing Street tomorrow, **Friday 5 July**, with at least the Cabinet confirmed by the end of the day and further ministerial appointments over the next few. We should also find out about any big machinery of government changes at that point - keep an eye on whether DSIT does indeed become [the digital centre of government](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organisation-digital-labour-government-unpacking-tech-william-tjhuf/). Parliament will [meet on Tuesday 9 July](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/state-opening-of-parliament-to-take-place-on-17-july-2024), when MPs will be sworn in and the speaker elected. The [state opening](https://www.parliament.uk/stateopening/) and King’s Speech - which will outline the government’s legislative agenda - will take place on **Wednesday 17 July**.

Neither the [Sunday Times’](http://thetimes.com/article/1cf1227d-2fe2-4104-ae5e-c82bfcd91f4e?shareToken=0585150c2ee81aac3d7b2b8f7afc9646) nor [the Guardian’s](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/03/no-drama-starmer-how-labour-would-govern) previews of the early weeks of a possible Labour government mention data or AI being among the King’s Speech bills, but it’s something to keep an eye on.

### **News Tory** {#tory}
In my haste to go for [a funny one-liner last time round](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/06/27/data-policy-digest#tory), I of course forgot to mention that one of the Tory officials being investigated for betting on the election date was… [the party’s chief data officer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c511nv3pjd6o). We regret the error. As, I suspect, do they.

### **Labour movement** {#labour}
I wondered aloud with the use of a library analogy, [How should we think about a National Data Library?](https://gavin-freeguard.medium.com/how-should-we-think-about-a-national-data-library-dd2d47edee8b) One of the authors of Onward’s report on the subject [added their views](https://x.com/anastasiabekt/status/1808494156043501879); Emily pointed me towards the [election asks of CILIP](https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/election24), which represents librarians; and my friend Dave happened to blog about his experience working on the highly-relevant [GOV.UK Registers](https://medium.com/desiderium-sciendi/what-really-happened-to-gov-uk-registers-a9061a305f18) programme.

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space - Chatham House - to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges. We’re delighted that one of the presentations will be from Robin Carpenter, Ethics and Governance Lead for the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare at King’s College London, on [Collaborating well with patients when developing healthcare AI](https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/news/blog-collaborating-well-patients-when-developing-healthcare-ai).
