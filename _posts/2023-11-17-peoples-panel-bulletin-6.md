## Deliberation in depth: Summary Findings Report

Panel facilitators [Hopkins Van Mil](http://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/) have been typing up flip-charts and transcribing sessions to [produce this summary findings]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/projects/peoplespanel/Peoples Panel on AI Summary Findings - Final.pdf) report which shows the thinking behind the Panel’s recommendations, and offers more in-depth insights into the hopes and concerns around AI that we explored, as well as public priorities and expectations for government, industry, academia and civil society. 

Take a look to explore Panel perspectives on:

* **Values and principles that should underpin AI:** from international involvement and protections for the right to work, to kindness, empathy and emotional intelligence, and a focus on addressing the problems we face today, including struggles of younger generations, and increasing marginalisation. 
* **The red-lines that should be set**: including no AI-driven increases in societal inequality or division, profiling that undermines equality, abuse of personal data, or replacing human interaction where it is the best option for society, or in critical roles such as judges, jurors and court decisions. 
* **Future public involvement in AI decision making**: including agreeing who should be involved in the conversation, making sure public involvement is meaningful and focussed on values as well as technology, and equipping stakeholders to listen to public voice.

Plus, the report contains quotes from the panel on their experiences of being involved, and feedback from the online and in-person audience at our presentation event. 

We’re looking forward next week to the completion of the independent evaluation of the Panel, and we’ll be drawing on that, alongside the [Summary Findings Report]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/projects/peoplespanel/Peoples Panel on AI Summary Findings - Final.pdf), to produce a final write-up. 

## The People’s Panel is not over: Upcoming opportunities

The fifth recommendation of the Panel was for “a continued national conversation on AI, including retaining the People’s Panel” and we’re exploring how to make this happen. 

* On 6th December Sharif and Janet from the panel will be [speaking in the opening plenary of the TechUK Digital Ethics Summit in London](https://www.techuk.org/digital-ethics-summit-2023-seizing-the-moment/agenda.html). Free registration for the event is still available.  
* The majority of members of the Panel have committed to ongoing involvement - and we are planning for a series of Zoom meetings over the coming months.  If you have a topic for discussion with the Panel, and would be interested in taking part in one of these Zoom sessions, [please get in touch](mailto:tim@connectedbydata.org). 

> _“Taking part has been an absolute privilege. It has been insightful – it has left me with a lot of hope. I would like to think we can continue this process. I would like to think we can be a part of a journey.” _Panel member

## Ripples: AI & Climate

We were happy to see a reference to the People’s Panel in[ this write-up from Global Action Plan of their recent event on the relationship between AI and climate change](https://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/news/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-relationship-between-ai-and-climate-changeby-tanya-goodin). 

We’d love to hear about other places the recommendations or outputs of the panel are being referenced or used.
