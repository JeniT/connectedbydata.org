### What I’ve been doing
The team face to face meetup was good as always. We had a range of conversations and progressed some pressing projects but also had space to look forward and think about other things we may like to be doing. 

This week we submitted a big funding bid which, for both financial and impact reasons, I hope is progressed. It’s just the start of the process but we really believe in supporting community campaigns around data. 

The write up of the [Connected Conversation on generative AI](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-17-connected-conversation-gen-ai) is now online - I remembered to share it here! It is worth a read I think, I’m still thinking about elements of it a couple of weeks on.

A number of our projects are wrapping up in coming months so we’re having to spend time on reports back to funders. I’m tracking and mapping that work to ensure its spread evenly and submitted on time.

### What I need to take care of
We’ve got plans for a number of events (ranging in size, type, location) over the next five months and I want to get a broad map sorted for what needs planning and when. For example we’re talking about an unconference in March and whilst on the day that may be a relaxed experience, it’ll need some good lead in planning. We’ve also got plans for some events with parliamentarians and a design lab with civil servants (and others). Throw in the AI Action Summit in February (both in Paris and the Fringe in London) and associated events, a Connected Conversation around procurement and AI, = it’s a busy period ahead. 

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
I have a well documented love of musical theatre. I once travelled to Germany to watch my favourite production, [Starlight Express](https://www.starlight-express.de/), in its permanent home. It was performed in German of course (which I don’t speak!) but it proved to me that musical theatre can transcend language. That was evident to me again with [this recent celebration](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBgK6PWoJF_/) (Insta video) in the West End of Disney’s The Lion King 25th anniversary in London. 

And whilst I’m plugging it - not an ad - a new production of [Starlight Express](https://www.starlightexpresslondon.com/) is now in London (Wembley) running until October 2025. See it if you can! (not sponsored, just a fan girl).

### What I’ve been reading
I’m currently reading for pleasure ‘[A Very Modern Family](https://www.awesomebooks.com/book/9780349434728/a-very-modern-family/used)’ by Carrie and David Grant. It was recommended by colleague Tim and it’s a great read about living inclusivity as a parent.
