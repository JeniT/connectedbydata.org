### What I’ve been doing
* Social media scheduling.  We’ve had a little flurry of catching up on event write ups and advertising.
* Failing to organise refreshments at a workshop Tim is running in Brussels next week.  I get frustrated by things like that.
* Doing the insurance renewal.
* Prepping for our first team monthly meetup on Monday in London.
* Tidying our budget / finance spreadsheets including adding the next two financial years and correcting some errors (and re-forecasting a project and balancing staff time allocations).

### What I need to take care of
* Hoping to receive the draft end of year accounts this week - those will need finalising, adding to our draft annual report and some pending funding bids.
* Prep for a panel I’m speaking on in June 2024 (it’s a libraries hosted event which is why I’m going rather than another team member).
* Writing up our flipping fundraising plan that I’ve been procrastinating on since we had the discussions two weeks ago.  In fact, I may force myself to do that now.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by

CW: Profanity.

I like to be challenged around inclusivity and taking action.  I particularly welcome being pushed to be intentional and meaningfully engaged.  This post on Mastodon the other day did just that - I’ve been the recruiter that asks “a diversity question” thinking that’s a good thing to do but utterly failing to realise (until now) what that’s like if you’re not asking it of someone who isn’t in the minority).

I do note that there is an element of mindset here.  As a gay woman that has done a bit to promote equality I have previously considered a “diversity question” to be an area I can stand out from others.  But now I have to wonder if I’d ask it, or how I’d ask it. And (not that I have an plans to be interviewed any time soon) how I’d answer it.

### What I’ve been reading
I’ve been sucked in (still reading slower / less frequently than I used to) by [Robert Harris](https://twitter.com/robert___harris?lang=en-GB)’ ‘[Act of Oblivion](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Robert-Harris/Act-of-Oblivion--The-Sunday-Times-Bestseller/27939062)’.  He is a storyteller that never fails to grab me and I love the way he takes historical fact and weaves fiction through it.  His [‘Conclave’](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Robert-Harris/Conclave--Soon-to-be-a-major-film/20612554) is a real favourite of mine.
