Hello, and welcome to our 23rd Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. 

There have been a lot. But you knew that already. Because there always is. And will no doubt continue to be. Now, and forevermore. Amen. 

<!--more-->

I hope you manage to get some time off to rest and recharge! But if you’re around on **20 August**, we’ll be holding an extended meeting of our Data and AI Civil Society Network to think about strategy for the months ahead - [do join us if you can](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/).

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**. We’re on Twitter [@ConnectedByData](https://twitter.com/connectedbydata) and [@DataReform](https://twitter.com/DataReform).

## **Data policy developments** {#data-policy-developments}


### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}

**Digital Information and Smart Data Bill (DISD)** Rumours, from [Politico Morning Tech UK](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/morning-tech-uk/) and elsewhere, suggest this Bill (which [the King’s Speech](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/07/19/data-policy-digest#bills-bills-bills) sold as the less controversial bits of DPDIB, but with some hostages to fortune about ‘targeted reforms to some data laws’) could arrive in parliament by October.

Insofar as there has been discussion, it’s been around health data and the government’s apparent desire not to learn from [previous experience](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/general-practice-data-planning-and-research): [Labour ‘won’t be squeamish about making money from NHS data’](https://www.thetimes.com/article/800ba103-3a6d-409e-9953-df70f16adf76?shareToken=1317698c9ee61d5b274a1f69cf98b56c) (The Times) prompted responses including [one from Jess Morley](https://x.com/jessRmorley/status/1817165057555321044), while The Observer had [Scientists urge GPs to share UK patient data for research into new treatments](https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/scientists-urge-gp-share-uk-patient-data-research-into-new-treatments) (The Observer).

Elsewhere… [Light and Shadow of the Digital Information and Smart Data Bill](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/light-and-shadow-of-the-digital-information-and-smart-data-bill/) (ORG)... [Data sharing is key to boosting SME financing, says taskforce](https://www.uktech.news/fintech/data-startup-financing-sme-taskforce-20240805) (UKTN)... [the CMA welcomed the Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-living-update/cma-cost-of-living-update) as paving the way for new smart data schemes but wants an interim arrangement… and [Labour inches closer to digital ID cards](https://unherd.com/newsroom/labour-inches-closer-to-digital-id-cards/) (UnHerd).

Will the new Bill have anything on algorithmic transparency in the public sector, something covered by [previous DPDIB amendments](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/latest/ministers-urged-to-amend-data-bill-and-make-government-ai-transparent/) (and the previous government’s [original consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction))? The new government hasn’t managed to honour [the previous government’s pledge](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-05-07/24976) to publish a first batch of transparency records by the end of July, but one new entry has appeared for [NHS England’s NHS.UK Reviews Automoderation Tool](https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records/nhs-england-nhs-dot-uk-reviews-automoderation-tool). 

Meanwhile, [Public Law Project](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/) are updating their [Tracking Automated Government register](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/the-tracking-automated-government-register/) - a database of all government uses of automation to make or inform decisions that they’re aware of. They’d love any information you might have come across about automated decision making tools (including decision support tools) that could be included. Drop [Ellie](mailto:e.jones@publiclawproject.org.uk) and [Caroline](mailto:c.selman@publiclawproject.org.uk) an email if you have anything.

And now for the most controversial bit… Forget health data. Forget [sweeping DWP powers](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/dpdi-bill-new-welfare-surveillance-proposals-target-vulnerable-people/). The big bone of contention is… how should we abbreviate the new data Bill?

Last time out I suggested DISD should be ‘dizzed’. Anna [suggested ‘dissed’](https://x.com/anna_b_dent/status/1814320736107913684) instead. Tom offered [DISDaB](https://bsky.app/profile/tsjmcgrath.co.uk/post/3kxnghhimi42c). Peter brought some musical enticement to his [DISD-ee](https://x.com/peterkwells/status/1814324029303427557) idea. Since we could all do with some light relief, [I’ve set up a poll - vote now!](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZBYH6XH)

**AI Bill** A [written ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-07-26/hcws24) from Secretary of State Peter Kyle on 26 July promised legislation to ‘place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models’ and ‘place the AI Safety Institute on a statutory footing, providing it with a permanent remit to enhance the safety of AI over the longer term’. Its proposals would be ‘highly targeted’ and ‘avoid creating new rules for those using AI’, ‘instead apply[ing] to the small number of developers of the most powerful AI models with a focus on the AI systems of tomorrow and not today.’ The statement also promised ‘a consultation on these legislative proposals, to harness the insights and expertise of the AI industry, academia and civil society.’ This was reiterated by AI minister, Maggie Jones, [in the Lords](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-07-30/debates/C1541E2E-0AE3-486C-9077-42CBA1785164/AITechnologyRegulations) in late July, and was later [repeated by secretary of state Peter Kyle to tech companies](https://www.ft.com/content/ce53d233-073e-4b95-8579-e80d960377a4) over breakfast (more on that below).

Additionally… [AI Regulation: Will Labour Promote Growth and Protect Rights?](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/ai-regulation-will-labour-promote-growth-and-protect-rights/) (ORG)... [Paranoid politicians could destroy online satire](https://capx.co/paranoid-politicians-could-destroy-online-satire/) (Centre for Policy Studies)... while Amnesty described the EU’s AI Act as a [’modest step’](https://www.amnesty.eu/news/statement-eu-takes-modest-step-as-ai-law-comes-into-effect/) as it came into effect.

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill** The urgency of this one - ‘When I became secretary of state, within a very short period of time, and I’m talking hours, not multiple days, I became very, very aware that there was a cybersecurity challenge that our country faced that I simply wasn’t aware of before becoming secretary of state’ - bumped the AI Bill from the King’s Speech, [according to The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/29/uk-desperately-exposed-to-cyber-threats-and-pandemics-says-minister).

**Other** Bills we highlighted [last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/07/19/data-policy-digest#bills-bills-bills) included the **Employment Rights Bill** - [PCS AI campaign to ensure workplace justice](https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/pcs-ai-campaign-ensure-workplace-justice) (PCS)... and **Product Safety and Metrology Bill**, which ‘opens the door to British alignment with EU standards’ and ‘could prove to be similar to the new EU Digital Services Act (DSA), a sprawling rulebook designed to address everything from illegal online content to dangerous goods sold in online marketplaces’ [according to Politico](https://pro.politico.eu/news/keir-starmer-brexit-uk-politics-borders-product-saftey-bill-brussels-eu-policy-supply-chains-backlash)… on which note, [TikTok commits to permanently withdraw TikTok Lite Rewards programme from the EU to comply with the Digital Services Act](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4161) (European Commission), see also [TikTok Lite Leaves up to 1 Billion Users With Fewer Protections](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-lite-global-south/) (Wired).

**Private Members Bills** The Lords have conducted their [ballot for private members’ bills](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/publications/briefings/back-to-business-pmb-ballot) - those are ones that can be introduced by anyone, rather than the government, though normally rely on government support to get through. Lord Clement-Jones (Lib Dem) and his Public Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision-Making Systems Bill [were drawn 17th](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/july/lords-private-members-bills-ballot-2024/) - it’ll get a first reading on Monday 9 September. The Commons ballot [will happen on Thursday 5 September](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/88398/Pdf?subType=Standard#page=5), and the winning bills will be ‘presented’ in parliament on Wednesday 16 October.


### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}

The machinery of government changes - moving the Government Digital Service, Central Digital and Data Office and Incubator for AI from Cabinet Office to DSIT - were made official with [a written prime ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-07-24/hcws19) (summary from [Civil Service World](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/eu-responsibility-moves-to-cabinet-office-as-multiple-mog-changes-announced?s=03), while Politico looks through [a Cabinet Office lens](https://www.politico.eu/article/labour-united-kingdom-cabinet-office-shake-up/)). [Another written statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-07-26/hcws24), from DSIT Sec of State Peter Kyle, announced that Matt Clifford - chair of [ARIA](https://www.aria.org.uk/) and previously one of the PM’s [representatives to the AI Safety Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/matt-clifford-what-does-the-future-of-ai-look-like) - will lead an [Action Plan to ensure UK reaps the benefits of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-expert-to-lead-action-plan-to-ensure-uk-reaps-the-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence) (DSIT), with a Unit to support the work (DSIT has published the [terms of reference for the action plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-ai-opportunities-action-plan-terms-of-reference)).

While we’re on appointments… it was announced that [Emily Middleton](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/emily-middleton-45053152), who advised Peter Kyle before the election (on secondment from Public Digital into Labour Together), would [‘lead the design of the new digital centre of UK government’](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7224022945193492480/) as [a new director general](https://x.com/vmanancourt/status/1816443822731120740?t=lfclGMiyqSq07ayca8N0hw&s=03). Shadow DSIT secretary. Andrew Griffith, [wrote to the Cabinet Secretary](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/26/Letter-to-Simon-Case-26-07-24.pdf) about his concerns, ‘not about the merits of the individual concerned but rather the much more important issue of civil service independence’ (former Cabinet Office minister [Alex Burghart](https://x.com/alexburghart/status/1816533688353456274) and former Cabinet Office spad [Henry Newman](https://whitehallproject.substack.com/p/failing-the-sniff-test) also got involved, while Politico report [a hire under ‘exceptions’ rules](https://www.politico.eu/article/labour-donor-bag-plum-uk-treasury-job-ian-corfield/) in the Treasury). Elsewhere, Varun Chandra stepped down from managing partner at strategic advisory firm (or [‘spooky consultancy’](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1582/news)), Hakluyt, after being [appointed as the prime minister’s special adviser on business and investment](https://hakluytandco.com/news/holly-morrow-appointed-hakluyts-acting-managing-partner-following-varun-chandras-move-into-uk-government/) (which [had been rumoured](https://news.sky.com/story/hakluyt-chief-chandra-lined-up-for-top-labour-business-role-13175729)). 

We’re also still getting details of [ministerial briefs](https://labour.org.uk/about-us/the-cabinet/) across government: [Justin Madders MP](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/justin-madders) at the Department for Business and Trade gets smart data, regulation, employment rights, competition and consumer protection among other subjects; [Abena Oppong-Asare MP](https://www.abenaoppongasare.com/) is the junior Cabinet Office minister [responsible for transparency policy and freedom of information](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/abena-oppong-asare) (not sure Labour has [much in the way of FOI policy yet](https://x.com/rosenbaum6/status/1818614228598616230)); and Public Technology has more on Heidi Alexander, responsible for [AI and digital at the Ministry of Justice](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/08/05/public-order-justice-and-rights/moj-appoints-minister-to-oversee-ai-and-digital-reform), and on DSIT’s minister for AI and digital government, [Feryal Clark](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/07/19/government-and-politics/feryal-clark-named-minister-for-ai-and-digital-government). Newly-elected [Callum Anderson MP](https://x.com/_CallumAnderson/status/1814306660493439231), meanwhile, becomes the parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the DSIT ministerial team - their main bridge with the parliamentary party. And the Spectator has a broader though incomplete [list of special advisers](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/starmers-special-advisers-a-complete-guide/) across government.

As for departures… Simon Blagden [resigned as chair of Building Digital UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/simon-blagden-resigns-as-chair-of-bduk) (a DSIT agency tasked with reliable broadband and mobile coverage) - [Private Eye says](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1582/news) this was over ‘dishonesty over his role in the Post Office scandal’... while [Ben Johnson](https://x.com/ersatzben/status/1818316306522718273), a DSIT adviser under Michelle Donelan, and [Nitarshan Rajkumar](https://x.com/nitarshan/status/1820429667062681639), a cofounder of the AI Safety Institute, announced they were leaving government.

And as for people still in post… DSIT sec Peter Kyle gave [an interview to the Times](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/labour-peter-kyle-reading-age-c9hwtdknz). Topics included his career to date and experience as a dyslexic minister, kindness, tech pessimism - which he says characterised the previous government - and optimism, online safety, the UK being taken ‘right to the cliff edge’ on cyber security, productivity and poor public sector tech, rewiring Whitehall, an insistence there will be no compulsory ID cards but wanting people to access government easily, and the power of big tech (‘We cannot sit in Whitehall or Brussels or Washington and legislate and regulate to get those companies to do what we want them to do’) and their lack of diversity (‘miles behind’, ‘they are from a different era’). He also gave his [first speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/peter-kyles-speech-at-the-2024-farnborough-international-air-show) (at Farnborough air show, with lots about space) and visited the UK Biobank ([The industrial estate in Stockport at the heart of Labour's plans to fix the NHS](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/industrial-estate-stockport-heart-labours-29606762) - Manchester Evening News, [Nearly £50 million unlocked for world-leading UK Biobank following new industry backing](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nearly-50-million-unlocked-for-world-leading-uk-biobank-following-new-industry-backing) - DSIT). 

Kyle also co-hosted (with chancellor Rachel Reeves) [a breakfast roundtable](https://x.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1818651360838951213) with big tech. They discussed ‘continuing to use the power of technology & AI to improve lives across the UK’ with representatives of techUK, the Startup Coalition, a16z, Wayve, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Index Ventures, Apple and Digital Bridge, according to reporting from Politico and others. Misinformation around the tragic murders in Southport was apparently not on the agenda. Computer Weekly argued that [Government needs to meet with the IT users, implementors and managers to deliver its policy aims](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Computer-Weekly-Editors-Blog/Government-needs-to-meet-with-the-IT-users-implementors-and-managers-to-deliver-its-policy-aims) too, and we hope there are some of those pastries and untouched fruit salads for [communities and civil society too](https://x.com/JeniT/status/1818660328772690047). 

Among the other big news from DSIT was [Government shelves £1.3bn UK tech and AI plans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyx5x44vnyeo) (BBC, see the [reaction from Neil Lawrence](https://x.com/lawrennd/status/1819320322736234782))... and also from DSIT… [AI to reduce train delays, speed up NHS prescriptions and train construction workers gets £32 million boost](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-to-reduce-train-delays-speed-up-nhs-prescriptions-and-train-construction-workers-gets-32-million-boost)...

Away from DSIT… the government’s public spending audit, [Fixing the Foundations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fixing-the-foundations-public-spending-audit-2024-25), included [a few paragraphs on tech](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66ab7c2fce1fd0da7b59319a/E03171937_-_Fixing_the_foundations_-_public_spending_audit_2024-24_-_Web_Accessible_v2.pdf#page=23) (‘The government will create the conditions for successful digital adoption in the public sector by addressing legacy IT and utilising cloud services and data sharing’, which will allow the public sector to ‘realise the opportunities’ of AI)...

### **Tory story** {#tory-story}

Over on the opposition benches… the Conservative leadership contest has started in earnest, with Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel, Mel Stride, and Tom Tugendhat the contenders. ConservativeHome have [the full timetable](https://conservativehome.com/2024/07/22/1922-committee-proposes-rules-and-timeline-for-the-conservative-leadership-contest/), with the new leader being announced on 2 November.

Lopez and Griffith are backing Badenoch in the [leadership contest](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/whos-backing-whom-tory-leadership-race-begins/), Bhatti is backing Priti Patel.

As for other parties - I think the [Lib Dem](https://www.libdems.org.uk/people) and [Green](https://greenparty.org.uk/about/people/spokespeople/) frontbench spokespeople remain unchanged (so [Layla Moran](https://www.libdems.org.uk/candidates/oxford-west-and-abingdon) on DSIT for the Lib Dems, and [Jack Lenox](https://jacklenox.com/) on digital for the Greens).
