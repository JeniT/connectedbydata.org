Hello, and welcome to our 26th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments.

We’ll forego the usual fun, folksy intro because DEAR GOD this is already too long (for a change, etc). A new Bill, a new advisory panel on the digital centre of government, lots on health data… To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the only thing worse than there being far too much to talk about would be having nothing to talk about (he says, weeping into his computer keyboard).

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**. We’re on Twitter [@ConnectedByData](https://twitter.com/connectedbydata), Bluesky [@connectedbydata.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.bsky.social), and Mastodon [@ConnectedByData@social.coop](http://social.coop/@ConnectedByData).

**Digital Information and Smart Data Bill (DISD)**

NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISD CONTENT.

(I was very pleased with that pun and I’m not going to let the fact that the Bill is now called something else stop me using it.)

Yes, the new Data Bill has been introduced to parliament, but with a new name - the [Data (Use and Access) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825). The DUAB (Dwab? [Doo-wab?](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjmacaulay.bsky.social/post/3l76yqiv4552m)) got its [first reading](https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/3efaa711-faa4-480f-a643-f3058eacb232?in=15:49:55) in the Lords on Wednesday 23 October, [introduced](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-23/debates/6E45CDFA-ECB7-4853-8A45-FA1C1E189204/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)) by minister Baroness Jones. Despite reports it was coming, it didn’t actually appear in any listings of future business - totally normal country, etc - and was eventually [published in full](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/publications) a few hours after its introduction. [You can also read](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/publications) the explanatory notes, delegated powers memorandum (which justifies how it delegates powers, particularly to ministers), impact assessments on several elements (the Bill, the smart data provisions, the National Underground Asset Register, digital verification services, open data architecture information standards from DHSC and the new provisions on researchers’ access to data from social media platforms)

Oddly the government press release, [New data laws unveiled to improve public services and boost UK economy by £10 billion](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-data-laws-unveiled-to-improve-public-services-and-boost-uk-economy-by-10-billion), was embargoed until midnight on Thursday 24 October. DSIT published [some factsheets](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-use-and-access-bill-factsheets) along side it, too.

In short:
* Part 1 of the Bill deals with Smart Data schemes (or ‘customer data and business data’), Part 2 with Digital Verification Services, Part 3 the National Underground Asset Register and Part 4 Registers of Births and Deaths - these were all in the previous government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDIB)
* Part 5 deals with ‘data protection and privacy’. Some of the proposals from DPDIB - such as doing away with data protection officers - have been dropped, but there are still some areas that caused controversy last time round (including automated decision making and ‘recognised legitimate interests’ which would reduce safeguards). Chapter 2 of this part deals with privacy and electronic communications, including cookies
* Part 6 (with bits of part 5) would replace the Information Commissioner’s Office with an Information Commission (not hugely controversial) and place some new duties on it (a bit more controversial)
* Part 7 deals with other provisions, some of which mark a return from DPDIB (information standards in health and social care, coroner access to children’s social media data, public service delivery for businesses as well as individuals) but some of which are new (researcher access to data from social media platforms, smart meter communication services). Retention of biometric data returns but plans to abolish the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner do not.

In short, a lot of the less controversial bits of DPDIB have been retained; some things have gone from the data protection bits but there will still be concerns over mooted changes to automated decision making, legitimate interests and scientific research (among others) and the general use of secondary legislation by ministers; and there doesn’t seem to be anything (yet) on mooted changes to the use of health data (see the dedicated section under DSIT up and take notice, below).

Speaking of things not in the new Bill… you may remember some of the controversy around the previous Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was around the late insertion of powers for DWP to access data on people’s bank accounts. Those won’t be in DUAB - but, following [a trail at Labour Party conference](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/24/starmer-promises-swift-action-against-welfare-fraudsters), there will be a new [Fraud, Error and Debt Bill](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-10-08/HCWS114).

**AI Bill:** A narrow frontier-focused Bill, putting the AI Safety Institute on a statutory footing and making voluntary agreements between government and industry mandatory, is coming soon, accompanied by a consultation (which we understand may go wider).

Meanwhile… [California’s failed AI safety bill is a warning to Britain](https://www.politico.eu/article/california-us-ai-safety-bill-warning-uk/) (Politico). There’s more on that, in AI got ‘rithm, below.

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill:** We thought this might be the first of the DSIT Bills - instead, it’s coming in 2025, according to [a new collection of relevant documents](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill) published by the department.

**Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill:** Not to go all [Brenda from Bristol](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-39647518) on you, but… yes, another one, and one not mentioned in the King’s Speech: [New bill introduced in Parliament to clarify crypto’s legal status](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-bill-introduced-in-parliament-to-clarify-cryptos-legal-status) (MoJ).

While we’re on crypto, [Donald Trump has a new crypto venture. The industry is not impressed](https://www.ft.com/content/ab91cae1-0fdb-4363-b53c-a3a5be6dffd7) (FT) - I’ll leave the [final word on that to Giles Wilkes](https://bsky.app/profile/gilesyb.bsky.social/post/3l6osk4bqw22v). 

**Other King’s Speech Bills:** The [Product Safety and Metrology Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3752) has had its first and second readings in the Lords - committee stage (where peers will start scrutinising it line-by-line) starts on 4 November. The [Lords Library](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0053/) and [UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/the-brexit-bill-no-ones-talking-about/) have briefings. The Lords Constitution Committee is [concerned it’s a ‘skeleton bill’](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldconst/24/2402.htm) with a lot of secondary powers for ministers.

The [Employment Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3737) has had its first and second readings in the Commons, committee stage dates to be confirmed. Here’s [the government press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-unveils-most-significant-reforms-to-employment-rights), while [IFOW have a response](https://www.ifow.org/news-articles/ifow-response-to-publication-of-the-employment-rights-bill), [the TUC have a useful summary](https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/massive-boost-workers-rights-new-employment-rights-bill) (including of what’s yet to come, including work on digital surveillance of workers and a right to switch off) and [techUK look at what it means for the tech sector](https://www.techuk.org/resource/what-does-the-employment-rights-bill-mean-for-the-tech-sector.html).

And worth noting the [House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3755) is at committee stage in the Commons. That would abolish hereditary peers, including some data-interested ones (like former ministers Viscount Camrose and Lord Bethell).

**Online Safety Act:** As ever, let the [Online Safety Act Network newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/1b60922407ae/osa-network-online-safety-newsletter-20) be your comprehensive guide - they also have a summary of recent stories, [Safety by design: has its time finally come?](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/safety-by-design-has-its-time-finally-come/)

It’s one year since the Act passed: [Peter Kyle tweeted about the anniversary](https://x.com/peterkyle/status/1849706068210769938)… [the OSAN have a special newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/7706045cbc49/osa-network-online-safety-newsletter-17434413)… [The Online Safety Act is one year old.

**Private Member’s Bills:** [MPs present Private Members’ Bills to Parliament](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/october/mps-present-private-members-bills-to-parliament/) - the [Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3774) has understandably attracted most of the headlines, but (as per the OSA section above) there’s [at least one tech-relevant bill](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/89015/Html?subType=Standard#20241016-15) in the form of Josh McAllister’s [Protection of Children (Digital Safety and Data Protection)](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3778) Bill.

### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}
**The centre:** Starting with general government vibes, strategy, developments etc… As the government approached its first 100 days, [chief of staff Sue Gray departed](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/once-sue-gray-became-the-story-it-was-clear-she-had-to-go) and the prime minister reset his No 10 operation. [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/sue-gray-downing-street-100-days-election-victory-keir-starmer-british/) ([twice](https://www.politico.eu/article/keir-starmer-100-days-uk-election-downing-street-labour-party/)) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/12/the-inside-story-of-labours-first-100-days-in-power-keir-starmer) are among the news outlets with big reads on the first 100 days.

One of the big initiatives that bookmarked the first 100 days was the UK Investment Summit on 14 October - [‘Record-breaking International Investment Summit secures £63 billion and nearly 38,000 jobs for the UK’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-international-investment-summit-secures-63-billion-and-nearly-38000-jobs-for-the-uk) was the press release form the Department for Business and Trade. AI, data and tech got some mentions in [the PM’s speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-international-investment-summit-speech-14-october-2024) - he also sat down for [an interview with former Google CEO Eric Schimdt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpr1WpicZwY) (conducted by GSK’s CEO, Emma Walmsley), covered as [UK’s Keir Starmer: Don’t be scared of AI](https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-must-run-towards-ai-opportunities-says-keir-starmer/) by Politico and [Starmer: ‘There’s always an inhibition in government when it comes to technology and change’](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/10/17/government-and-politics/starmer-theres-always-an-inhibition-in-government-when-it-comes-to-technology-and-change/) by Public Technology. Starmer had told the Standard [We can make London the AI capital of the world. The opportunities to create wealth are endless](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-london-ai-wealth-b1184299.html) a couple of weeks earlier. Schmidt’s appearance caused some controversy given recent comments on AI and climate change - Disconnect’s [Silicon Valley is sacrificing the climate for AI](https://disconnect.blog/silicon-valley-is-sacrificing-the-climate-for-ai/) gives you a favour.

The Summit coincided with the publication of the UK’s new industrial strategy, [Invest 2035](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/invest-2035-the-uks-modern-industrial-strategy) (there’s [a consultation open until 24 November](https://ditresearch.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIx36f4hZ4D64IK), [a statement to parliament](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-10-14/hcws126), and [a shorter version](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invest-2035)). ‘Digital and Technologies’ is one of the eight ‘growth-driving sectors’ being prioritised (page 24 has more on the sector), while page 33 gives you ‘data in the industrial strategy’.

And don’t forget: Wednesday (30 October) is [Budget Day](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10122) (plus spending review) - that should tell us what projects are about to get funded and what budgets departments (including DSIT) will have to play with. There are a couple of pieces doing the rounds on Labour’s political economy, highly relevant to different perspectives on tech’s role: [Starmerism, what is it really?](https://williamcullernebown.substack.com/p/starmerism-what-is-it-really) (William Cullerne Bown) and [Bevin, Crosland or Blair? Labour’s rival political economies](https://renewal.org.uk/2024/10/15/bevin-crosland-or-blair-labours-rival-political-economies/) (Renewal). UKDayOne published [AI Industrial Strategy: A Plan for “Intelligence Too Cheap to Meter”](https://ukdayone.org/briefings/ai-industrial-strategy), while [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-growth-plan.html) and [the CBI](https://www.cbi.org.uk/articles/the-cbi-s-2024-autumn-budget-submission/) have got their asks in. Oh, and [Faulty jobs data leaves UK hiring picture uncertain, economists say](https://www.ft.com/content/84f0614c-9896-403f-ab0b-938677cfa8d1) (FT).

**People:** [New Cabinet Committees have been announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cabinet-committees-system-and-list-of-cabinet-committees), with the Prime Minister chairing one on Science and Technology (the [IfG explains what Cabinet Committees are](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/cabinet-committees), why they matter and how they’ve changed). A plea should anyone in Cabinet Office be reading this: GOV.UK allows you to keep historical versions listed on this page as well, or create a collection of previous announcements, rather than just overwriting what was there before with the latest list which is less than ideal.

You’ve missed the deadline if you wanted to apply for the most senior role in the civil service - [Cabinet Secretary](https://web.archive.org/web/20240930183208/https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWNsYXNzPUpvYnMmc2VhcmNoc29ydD1zY29yZSZqb2JsaXN0X3ZpZXdfdmFjPTE5MjQ0MTUmcGFnZWFjdGlvbj12aWV3dmFjYnlqb2JsaXN0JnVzZXJzZWFyY2hjb250ZXh0PTk4NTQ5MjE1Jm93bmVydHlwZT1mYWlyJm93bmVyPTUwNzAwMDAmc2VhcmNocGFnZT0xJnJlcXNpZz0xNzI3NzE0MTE4LWNkODVhZTEyZTg3MDEwOGE4MmExMzkyMzVmOGY0YmM2ZjVlNTk3NDI=). The [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/2458b73f-5d36-4fcc-96bb-d39f16fde728) and [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/cabinet-secretary-contenders-who-could-be-next-top-uk-civil-servant) look at the runners and riders, who include Ofcom chief Melanie Dawes (who was in the FT with [UK regulator preparing for ‘strong action’ against tech giants](https://www.ft.com/content/dde817fb-3ba7-4b16-b735-3ae1ec324c4c)). 

Cabinet Office is also looking for some [Non-Executive Board Members](https://apply-for-public-appointment.service.gov.uk/roles/8424) - deadline 14 November. ‘Promoting the release of government data, and making the way government works more transparent’ is still listed as one of their responsibilities, despite the move of GDS and CDDO to DSIT (h/t [Owen Boswarva](https://bsky.app/profile/owenboswarva.bsky.social/post/3l6rhfvn3yh23)). Meanwhile, government chief digital officer Mike Potter has left - [Government to share succession plans ‘in due course’ after chief digital officer departure](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/10/14/education-and-skills/government-to-share-succession-plans-in-due-course-after-chief-digital-officer-departure/), reports Public Technology.

Ministers have been busy: [Tech Secretary welcomes foreign investment in UK data centres which will spur economic growth and AI innovation in Britain](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-secretary-welcomes-foreign-investment-in-uk-data-centres-which-will-spur-economic-growth-and-ai-innovation-in-britain) (DSIT) - he’s also been [out in the US](https://x.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1849478649843417351) [speaking to tech firms](https://x.com/SciTechgovuk/status/1850106748465496521) - while Feryal Clark was in Italy for the [G7 Ministerial Declaration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g7-ministerial-declaration-cernobbio-italy-15-october-2024) (and here’s [the G7 Toolkit for Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/g7-toolkit-for-artificial-intelligence-in-the-public-sector_421c1244-en.html), courtesy of the OECD). CSW published [Meet the ministers: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/in-depth/article/ministerial-profiles-dsit) to coincide with Labour conference.

**Institutions:** [Game-changing tech to reach the public faster as dedicated new unit launched to curb red tape](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/game-changing-tech-to-reach-the-public-faster-as-dedicated-new-unit-launched-to-curb-red-tape) was how DSIT announced the new Regulatory Innovation Office, which readers may remember as a [longstanding](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/labour-will-end-regulatory-backlogs-to-give-the-public-access-to-life-saving-treatments-sooner/) Labour promise. There was a [written statement](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-08/debates/24100881000009/RegulatoryInnovationOffice) in parliament too. You have until 19 November if you’d like to [apply to chair it](https://apply-for-public-appointment.service.gov.uk/roles/8418). And as noted above, [the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-digital-identities-and-attributes) has launched.

But here at Connected by Data towers (metaphorically - we don’t actually have a building, let alone towers), the big one was the new advisory panel to help DSIT shape the new digital centre: [Tech experts to shape government digital vision to drive innovation and boost public services](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-experts-to-shape-government-digital-vision-to-drive-innovation-and-boost-public-services) (DSIT), featuring our own executive director, Jeni Tennison. Baroness Martha Lane Fox is one of the co-chairs (with CDDO chair Paul Willmott), blogging about the first meeting ([Working in the open – digital government in the U.K. in 2024](https://medium.com/@marthalanefox/digital-government-2024-2687912d3ec1)), while other members include Poppy Gustafsson, former CEO of cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who was [appointed as UK investment minister days later](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/10/ex-darktrace-ceo-poppy-gustafsson-appointed-uk-investment-minister).

Jeni [blogged about some of her initial reflections](https://connectedbydata.org/blog/2024/10/07/dcd-first-reflections), having sparked a fantastic [discussion on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jenitennison.com/post/3l5h63ljjvr2y) (honestly people, come on in, the water’s lovely).

### **Conference calls** {#conference-calls}
Conference season is now over for another year (though some parties, including the Lib Dems and Greens, often have big spring conferences as well). As of the previous edition of the Digest, we’d had [SNP conference](https://www.snp.org/events/snp-90th-annual-national-conference-2024/) in Edinburgh, [Green conference](https://greenparty.org.uk/get-involved/conference/) in Manchester (where a motion on [‘Addressing the Dire Need for AI Regulation’](https://www.greencoordinate.co.uk/motions/addressing-the-dire-need-for-ai-regulation/) was passed), and [Lib Dem conference](https://www.libdems.org.uk/conference) in Brighton. There was also [TUC Congress](https://www.tuc.org.uk/Congress2024) in Brighton, where successful motions included 76, on [Young workers, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation](https://congress.tuc.org.uk/motion-76-young-workers-artificial-intelligence-ai-and-automation/#sthash.05bBpTML.dpbs), and a composite motion (C16) bundling together several others relating to [AI regulation, equality, skills, training, and the arts](https://congress.tuc.org.uk/c16-artificial-intelligence-regulation-equality-skills-training-and-the-arts/#sthash.CNXU273j.dpbs).

We’ve now had [Reform](https://www.reformparty.uk/reform_uk_2024_national_conference) (the party, not the thinktank) in Birmingham, then [Labour](https://labour.org.uk/annual-conference/) in Liverpool, the [Conservatives](https://www.conservatives.com/conference) in Birmingham and [Plaid Cymru](https://www.partyof.wales/conference) in Cardiff.

[Our spreadsheet hopefully caught all the data, AI and tech-related events at conferences](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbZlT1ColiwokPdVgaSXhtF5tyw8FBRehEyuAWlhXto/edit?usp=sharing) - there’s now an extra column for any video, audio or write ups of the events. Please do add any you’ve seen.

At Labour conference (which is somehow more than a month ago)… Peter Kyle did [a short speech](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/peter-kyle-mp-secretary-of-state-for-science-innovation-and-technology-speech-at-labour-party-conference-2024/) on the main conference floor. I tried to keep track of [the events I went along to](https://bsky.app/profile/gavinfreeguard.bsky.social/post/3l4snq35fgj2y). I thought that (while not a jubilant victory lap) the general mood was not quite as downbeat as reported, the data/AI conversations were more practical and grounded than they might have been, the new intake includes some MPs with a real interest and expertise in data and tech, and there was some consensus emerging between different sectors even while some ministers are still paying more attention to big tech talking points. 

That said… [Did you drink the AI Kool-Aid?](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-tanner-rootcause_did-you-drink-the-ai-kool-aid-there-was-activity-7245003548910915584-0rVu/) asked Jonathan Tanner, while other reflections, stories and spin-offs included [Science minister hints at new ‘mission-led’ R&D fund](https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-uk-politics-2024-9-science-minister-hints-at-new-mission-led-r-d-fund/) (Research Professional News)...

### **Parly-vous data?** {#parly-vous-data}
The biggest news is of course the introduction of the Data (Use and Access) Bill - see [Bills, bills, bills](#bills-bills-bills) for more on that, and (while we’re feeling legislative) the Private Members’ Bills ballot.

So let’s kick off with select committees, which scrutinise the work of the government. Last time out, [select committee chairs](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/09/20/data-policy-digest#parly-vous-data) had just been elected with former shadow minister, Chi Onwurah MP (Labour), leading the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee. Labour and Conservative members have now been elected by their respective parliamentary parties and [appointed](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-and-technology-committee/membership) - they’re Emily Darlington, Allison Gardner, Steve Race, Josh SImons, Lauren Sullivan and Adam Thompson for Labour, and former ministers George Freeman and Kit Malthouse for the Conservatives (that came earlier than expected, with rumours that the Tories would wait until after their leadership contest). Lib Dems Tom Gordon and Martin Wrigley [will complete the committee on Monday](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/89267/Html?subType=Standard#20241024-29). [Other committees](https://committees.parliament.uk/committees/) are in a similar position.

As for everything else that’s happened… in the Commons, on 7 October there were only a few mentions of data and AI in the [debate on the Darzi Review of the NHS](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-07/debates/FA1EE26A-62F4-4A3B-B1E3-E61313F46977/NHSPerformanceDarziInvestigation)… on 16 October, it was [Science, Innovation and Technology question time](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-16/debates/268EA404-6A55-45AD-A9E8-DDB74C519622/OralAnswersToQuestions)… on 17 October it was [Culture, Media and Sport questions](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-17/debates/C616B090-4249-46A8-8CE7-C18F3897115D/OralAnswersToQuestions), featuring some on AI… there was also a written question on digital inclusion which Public Technology wrote up as: [Minister slams ‘scandal’ of failure to update digital inclusion strategy since 2014](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/10/10/society-and-welfare/minister-slams-scandal-of-failure-to-update-digital-inclusion-strategy-since-2014/), and the good folk of the Commons Library have set up a Bluesky account to help track [written answers to DSIT questions](https://bsky.app/profile/dsit-answers.bsky.social)…

While in the Lords… on 9 October, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate (non-affiliated) had a question on [computer science applications to English universities](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-09/debates/3DFA9449-FEEF-429D-B996-3301F0B17D56/ComputerScienceApplicationsToEnglishUniversities) and a debate brought by Baroness Neville-Rolfe (Conservative) on [public sector productivity](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-09/debates/3FBE01A8-6DBF-486D-8F6F-E3DFFAD26691/PublicSectorProductivity) touched on digital transformation… on 14 October, Baroness Benjamin (Lib Dem) asked about the [independent pornography review](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-14/debates/84ECD50A-2E2D-46BD-9C82-21B2EBDAD7F2/IndependentPornographyReview) commissioned by the previous government… on 15 October, Baroness Chakrabarti (Labour) asked about the [Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-15/debates/517B29DF-B7F9-43BF-9EEB-C5448EE6D53D/FrameworkConventionOnArtificialIntelligence), and the Lords Communications and Digital Committee heard from ministers in the final evidence session for their [future of news inquiry](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21985)… on 16 October, the International Agreements Committee took [evidence on data and digital trade](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21987) from ministers and civil servants… on 18 October, Lord Holmes (Conservative) asked ‘whether [the government] plan to [regulate artificial intelligence](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-10-17/debates/D8B7A670-2E3B-4E0B-9923-A538C12CB7EA/ArtificialIntelligenceRegulation) and, if so, which uses they intend to regulate’... on 22 October, the (Lords) Science and Technology committee [quizzed the Government Chief Scientific Adviser](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21941)… and the European Affairs Committee wrote to the DSIT Secretary as part of their inquiry on [UK-EU data adequacy](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8338/ukeu-data-adequacy/publications/) (Computer Weekly [have a summary](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366614734/Lords-committee-warns-about-risks-of-the-UK-losing-its-EU-data-adequacy))…

Coming up in the Commons… 29 October, Westminster Hall debate on [Online safety for children and young people](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49253) brought by Lola McEvoy (Labour)… 20 November: DSIT questions… 28 November: DCMS questions… 5 December: Cabinet Office questions… 

Coming up in the Lords… 29 October, [first oral evidence session](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/22048) for the Communications and Digital Committee’s inquiry into [Scaling up - AI and creative tech](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8502/scaling-up-ai-and-creative-tech)… 31 October, debate brought by Viscount Stansgate (Labour) on [The contribution of science and technology to the UK economy](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49067)… 5 November, question from Baroness Fox (non-affiliated) on [‘Ensuring accurate and consistent data on sex and gender are collected from future Census questions to ensure robust official data’](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49060)... 11 November, a question from Lord Clement-Jones (Lib Dem) on [‘The Vallance review into the regulation of emerging digital technologies](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49112), and the relationship between intellectual property rights and the training of generative AI models’... 18 November, a question from Lord Kempsell (Conservative) on [‘Improving the use of evaluation in government policy-making’](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49226)...

Don’t forget: [the Budget (and first part of the Spending Review)](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10122/) takes place on Wednesday 30 October, with a few days of debate to follow.

[APPGs](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/apg/) are informal cross-party groups of parliamentarians interested in particular topics - some of them can be quite active, with events and even reports (and if nothing else may be useful for seeing which MPs and peers are interested in certain issues).

### **AI got ‘rithm** {#ai-got-rithm}
**For whom Nobel tolls:** An interestingly AI-dominated set of Nobel Prizes have been announced in the last few weeks. The prize for [Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/summary/) was won by John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton ‘for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks’, while the prize for [Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/summary/) was divided, with one half awarded to David Baker ‘for computational protein design’, and the other half to [Demis Hassabis](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/) and [John M. Jumper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) ‘for protein structure prediction’.  

Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson won the [Economics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2024/press-release/) prize ‘for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity’. You may have encountered some of their ideas including the ‘narrow corridor’ which UCL’s David Eaves has applied specifically to [digital government](https://medium.com/iipp-blog/the-narrow-corridor-and-the-future-of-digital-government-cf66718d3781). A critique of the laureates’ work has also been doing the rounds: [The Nobel for Econsplaining](https://www.ft.com/content/1e2584d6-65ef-46de-bfb2-28811be65600) (FT).
