### What I’ve been doing
This week we’ve had our usual project check ins and good progress is being made across the portfolio.  Things have been slightly disrupted (where haven’t they?!) by the announcement of a General Election and as a result we’ve been re-prioritising some capacity and activities.  We’d already launched a [progressive manifesto for data and AI policy](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision) at a Fringe event of the Labour Party Autumn Conference so our focus is predominantly now on the first 100 days / transition / and preparing for a new data reform Bill (as the awful Data Protection and Digital Information Bill didn’t make it through the dissolution of parliament).

We’ve also got [our next Design Lab](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-20-contributing-to-the-data-campaigners-toolkit) coming up fast and we’re running quite up against the wire on getting that planned. This project (the community campaigns on data) was delayed starting and we’ve never quite managed to get back ahead of the curve.

Today I attended a webinar about [Civitates](https://civitates-eu.org/)’ new [strategic framework](https://civitates-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civitates-Strategie-2024-Short.pdf?ver=1714721852) and the launch event of [Public Voices in AI](https://digitalgood.net/dg-research/public-voices-in-ai/).  Both are interesting from a fundraising perspective but mainly from a insight as to where organisations (UK and European) are focusing efforts.

The highlight of my week though was speaking on a panel at the [Libraries Connected](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/) Annual [Seminar](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/training-and-events/libraries-connected-annual-seminar-2024-%E2%80%9Cpower-partnership). You can read [my write up of that event here](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-06-05-libraries-connected-annual-seminar). One personal reflection I’ve had about potential algorithm implementation in libraries I didn’t have a chance to share, so I capture here.

"When I was a young girl using Essex Libraries and questioning my sexuality there was a book by Mark Mcleod which was an anthology of what we’d now consider to be LGBTQ+ stories.  There was no way on this Earth I would risk taking that book home so the library - and its anonymity - was my sanctuary.  I used to tuck the book behind the others on the shelf so I knew it’d be there the next week and I could read the next chapter. 

Fast forward to now and there are already algorithms being used to produce lists of books on library shelves that aren’t being used (“dead stock”) or being borrowed more than anticipated (“grubby stock”). A human intervention in “weeding” is essential, taking the list the library management system produces of books to be removed from the shelves but then providing a contextual view of each book. In my example, when I worked in libraries if I had come across a low issue book like this - and partially hidden - I think I’d have recognised the importance of that book being on the shelf. A less personal example of this risk is evident around beautiful huge hardback art books that are often impractical for people to carry home but art lovers sit for hours in a library pouring over the books they couldn’t afford / store at home themselves.  There’s no data evidencing the usage or value of these books, but library staff all know - all see it.

But even more concerning - what if I did borrow that book and the library utilised algorithms to promote “you may like” type books to me?  I may like those books…but I also may not appreciate knowing that the library is monitoring what I’m reading.  And the library service may not know or understand (or have considered) where that anonymised data is also being fed into training the algorithm (to get better recommendations). We only have to look across the pond to see how reading and book choice can be weaponised".


### What I need to take care of
Next week we’ll be needing to start recruitment for a group of people to be involved in a project we’ve been commissioned to contribute to (more on that when we can share).

I’m also hoping to receive our final version of end of year accounts which will then mean submitting a funding request, adding the final content to the draft annual report, and a funders report.

It’s also monthly reconciliation time and I’m attending a VAT related webinar.  I’m also looking forward to [this free online event](https://digitalgood.net/digital-identities-over-time-exhibition/) called ‘Digital Identities Over Time’.


### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
I was invited to attend the Libraries Connected Awards the night before I spoke at conference and it was wonderful to hear about [all the great work](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/page/libraries-connected-awards-shortlist-2024) going on in libraries across the country and hearing about the importance of managers trusting staff to deliver for their local community.


### What I’ve been reading
I’ve finished a book!  This week I finished Robert Harris’ “Act of Oblivion”.  I learned some historical stuff about a period and events I know nothing about, within a story of pace and intrigue. Robert Harris remains an excellent storyteller imho.
