## **Never mind the ballots** {#ballots}
If you’ve not already bookmarked it/made it your homepage/pledged to vote for it on 4 July, we’ve set up [a Data and AI Civil Society Network Election Hub](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/data-ai-civil-society-election-hub). We’ll be updating with resources throughout the campaign - and you can add to it, too! (And if you’d like to find out more about the network, visit our [dedicated website](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/).)


### **Manifesto destiny** {#manifesto}
After [last week’s manifestogeddon](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/06/14/data-policy-digest), a slightly quieter week. Nonetheless…

**Reform’s** [‘Our contract with you’](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/reformuk/pages/253/attachments/original/1718625371/Reform_UK_Our_Contract_with_You.pdf?1718625371) came out on Monday. Something for the first 100 days would be to ‘Promote Child Friendly App Restricted Smartphones: Social media is associated with eating disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide and the child mental health crisis’ and ‘launch an inquiry into social media harms’. Thereafter, Reform would review the Online Safety Bill (sic): ‘Social media giants that push baseless transgender ideology and divisive Critical Race theory should have no role in regulating free speech’. Other key pledges include a** **‘A British Bill of Rights’, including ‘Our data and privacy must be protected. Surveillance of the public must be limited and those monitoring us held to account’… ‘More Bobbies on the Beat’, partly through using ‘better technology and stop wasting time on paperwork’… and ‘Reform UK also opposes the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). We oppose a cashless society’.

**The SNP’s** manifesto, [A Future Made in Scotland](https://www.snp.org/manifesto/), came out yesterday (Wednesday)... BUILDING A FAIRER, GREENER ECONOMY (p21) they promised to ‘Prioritise research and investment in Artificial Intelligence to capitalise on the technological revolution and ensure its full potential is maximised in supporting our public services in a way that is open, ethical and transparent… CREATING A JUST AND HEALTHIER SCOTLAND (p25) ‘Protect people, particularly children, by ensuring the Online Safety Act comes into force on time. SNP MPs will press the UK Government to ensure tech firms cannot escape their responsibilities for the content on their platforms through full enforcement of the Act and prompt strengthening of these laws when required.’ (They’re obviously more interested in running the Scottish Government - [their 2021 manifesto](https://issuu.com/hinksbrandwise/docs/04_15_snp_manifesto_2021___a4_document) for reference.) 

Elsewhere… like Reform, George Galloway’s **[Worker’s Party](https://workerspartybritain.org/manifesto-britain-deserves-better/)** oppose a cashless society - they are not ‘Luddites’ but want AI and other technologies to be under ‘sufficient community control to ensure positive social and economic outcomes for the working class and the vulnerable’ and ‘institute a national debate’ on AI to ensure this… in previous industrial revolutions ‘the wealthy capitalist has seized opportunities by forced savings on the general population and then justified terrible effects on working people as ultimate progress. We cannot let this happen again’... they would also invest in technical skills for all workers, and review ‘all legislation and regulation to define only what is strictly harmful speech’, making it a criminal offence ‘to deny a political organisation or individual a platform’... 

In Northern Ireland, the **[Alliance](https://www.allianceparty.org/2024_westminster_manifesto) **notes the ‘enormous potential’ of AI and social media but ‘significant dangers’ if not properly regulated… AI should ‘be harnessed in a way that benefits society as a whole, whilst protecting human rights’... specific pledges include ‘a Digital Bill of Rights to protect everyone’s rights online’, to ‘Incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into UK law’, ‘Set up an independent advocacy body for children’s safety online’ and ‘Build on the measures introduced through the Online Safety Act to introduce verification requirements for social media accounts.’

As for civil society manifestos… there’s the [PLATFORM WORKERS MANIFESTO: 10 priorities to fix a broken gig economy](https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/manifesto) from Worker Info Exchange… while Defend Digital Me take a look at manifesto education pledges in [their latest newsletter](https://buttondown.email/DefendDigitalMe/archive/news-from-defend-digital-me-issue-june-2024/).
