## **Data policy developments**

### **Deeply DPDIB**

[Last time out](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/02/05/data-policy-digest), the rumours suggested the Bill would enter [Lords committee stage](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/lords/lrds-lords-committee-stage/) in late February. We’ve now heard it will be late March - on Wednesday 20, Monday 25 and Wednesday 27 March, then Monday 15, Wednesday 17, Monday 22, Wednesday 24, and Monday 29 April (with an extra day on Wednesday 1 May if necessary). 

[Amendments are already being laid](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications) (a reminder that, in ‘grand committee’, they can only be agreed unanimously - otherwise they’ll be brought up during the debate on report stage). They include one on [freeing the Postcode Address File](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/the-house-of-lords-could-liberate) and another on international data transfers and contractual clauses, which mover (and former ministerial shaker) [Lord (James) Bethell has written about](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/protecting-our-sensitive-data-when-wanders-overseas-james-bethell-kq3de/).

Regular readers will know we (and many others, including the [Commons](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/12/12/dpdib-commons-third-reading) and the [Lords](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-lords-2nd-reading-summary)) are concerned about the late and under-scrutinised addition of sweeping DWP powers to tackle fraud to the Bill. [A petition on the new DPDIB proposals](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/650940) currently has just over 20,000 signatures - and has [elicited a response from DWP](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/650940) (complaining about ‘misconceptions’, which could have been avoided had, say, the whole thing been scrutinised properly). While we’re on DWP, the Guardian reports that the department has [told Jobcentres to stop referring benefit claimants to food banks](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/16/jobcentres-told-to-stop-referring-benefit-claimants-to-food-banks), citing data privacy concerns. ‘Sceptical’ would be a kind word for [some](https://twitter.com/peterkwells/status/1758398064107065607) of the [responses](https://twitter.com/silkiecarlo/status/1758833215182127286) to that. ‘Disingenuous’ and ‘suspiciously conveniently timed’ would be others.

And… the Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee - which reports on the appropriateness of powers government is giving itself - was [not best pleased with some of the measures in the Bill](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/43322/documents/215723/default/)… there was a carry-over motion for the Bill, which means it can [continue to be debated until this parliament ends](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/84952/Html?subType=Standard#_idTextAnchor007)… and Baroness Kidron told the New Statesman [she’d like to see the Bill ‘overhauled’](https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/tech-regulation/online-safety/2024/02/baroness-kidron-online-safety-children-legal-protections).

We’ll be updating [our resources page](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources) on the Bill as briefings, etc, emerge. And… [the Open Rights Group have an online briefing THIS EVENING](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/events/briefing-on-data-protection-and-digital-information-bill/).

### **Bills, bills, bills**
**Online Safety Act** Esther Ghey has [called](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjmdz4plpxwo) for [further action](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/12/brianna-ghey-mother-warns-tech-bosses-more-children-will-die-without-action) to [protect children](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/12/i-want-to-make-things-better-esther-ghey-on-her-hopes-for-online-reform), following the recent conviction and naming of her daughter’s killers… she did [a big interview with Sky News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtXA5W7nu04) (which they [summarised](https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-rishi-sunak-general-election-keir-starmer-12593360?postid=7234306#liveblog-body))... [Brianna Ghey's mother and Molly Russell's father join forces to combat online harm](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68309102), reports the BBC… while [Diginomica report on a recent conference](https://diginomica.com/online-safety-act-childrens-champions-speak-out) touching on some of the issues - including some scepticism about whether some of the proposed measures would work as intended.

Also… the [Crown Prosecution Service has convicted](https://twitter.com/michelledonelan/status/1757165224723906762) a first person under cyberflashing provisions ([the BBC has more](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-68279259))... the ICO has issued [guidance on content moderation and data protection](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/online-safety-and-data-protection/content-moderation-and-data-protection/)… Politico looks at the [‘Great British Porn Block’](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-great-british-porn-block-is-back/) (not, as far as I know, a new Paul Hollywood/Prue Leith Channel 4 vehicle)... and [‘Ending hate on social media will cost billions’](https://www.newstatesman.com/encounter/2024/02/sheryl-sandberg-ending-hate-on-social-media-will-cost-billions), Meta veteran Sheryl Sandberg has said.

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** It will be [Report Stage next](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages/18121), with the government saying it [will continue the conversation](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-02-07/debates/D4DD33E1-DB0E-4E95-8FFE-ADE658264863/Debate) between now and then. Meanwhile the BBC reports that [Microsoft denies it went back on its word on Activision job cuts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68239644) (Digests [4](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/07/17/data-policy-digest) and [6](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/09/05/data-policy-digest) have more on where all of that came from). 

**Other bills** Last time, we noted an amendment to the Victims and Prisoners Bill about a [consistent victim identifier](https://twitter.com/NatalieByrom/status/1754215683779448843) - Natalie Byrom has more on [what happened next](https://twitter.com/NatalieByrom/status/1754559123834683694)… the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill has its [Second Reading in the Commons](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508/stages) today - the [Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9960/) has more… it’s [Lords Third Reading](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3506/stages) for the Automated Vehicles Bill… and the Media Bill has its [Second Reading in the Lords](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3505/stages) next week (the [Lords Library has a briefing](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0006/))…

Across the pond, ‘The [Justice in Forensic Algorithms Act](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074214/justice-in-forensic-algorithms-act-democrats-mark-takano-dwight-evans) would allow defendants to access the source code of software used to analyze evidence in their criminal proceedings’... meanwhile, across the channel (well, channels - English and [St George’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George%27s_Channel)), [the EU’s Digital Services Act](https://commission.europa.eu/news/new-rules-protect-your-rights-and-activity-online-eu-2024-02-16_en) came into force over the weekend - ‘This will see new responsibilities imposed on online platforms who have users in the EU, with the aim of better protecting those users and their rights’. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/eu-dsa-psa/), [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-union-digital-services-act-dsa-thierry-breton/) and [Amnesty](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/02/eu-landmark-digital-services-act-must-be-robustly-enforced-to-protect-human-rights/) are among those with takes.  

### **AI got ‘rithm**
Habemus charta alba! We have white smoke on [the government’s AI white paper response](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach-policy-proposals), with some [guidance for regulators](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-uks-ai-regulatory-principles-initial-guidance-for-regulators) on implementing the principles (Michelle Donelan has [written to some regulators](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-for-regulators-to-publish-an-update-on-their-strategic-approach-to-ai-secretary-of-state-letters) too), and [a name change for CDEI](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-cdei-is-now-the-responsible-technology-adoption-unit) for good measure. The [press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-signals-step-change-for-regulators-to-strengthen-ai-leadership) and [written statement to parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-02-06/debates/24020684000011/AIRegulationWhitePaperConsultationResponse) have summaries.

We thought the (sensible) context specific approach is [undermined by weak commitments](https://twitter.com/JeniT/status/1754943244776177901), a lack of practical steps and support and lip service to public voice (Jeni also [appeared on Channel 4 News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sq10EyoVD4)); Ada thought it was [‘all eyes, no hands’](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/press-release/statement-on-uk-ai-regulation/), having warned ministers not to wait for a [Post Office-style scandal before regulating AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/06/dont-wait-for-post-office-style-scandal-before-regulating-ai-ministers-told); the [Public Law Project](https://twitter.com/publiclawprojct/status/1754928771709169748) welcomed the move towards mandatory public sector algorithmic transparency, something [the ODI also cautiously welcomed](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/thoughts-on-the-government-response-to-the-ai-white-paper-consultation/) while worrying about the lack of money and powers for regulators; some Cambridge experts say government should [‘aim policies at “hardware” to ensure AI safety’](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/hardware-ai-safety); while [‘Rishi Sunak dithers on AI as the US and EU forge ahead’](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-ai-us-eu-forge-britian-london-chatgpt) was Politico’s take. Tech academic [Jennifer Cobbe’s exasperation](https://twitter.com/jennifercobbe/status/1754835025818787977) may also strike a chord with many.

Over in the EU, the European Parliament [voted on the AI Act last week](https://emeeting.europarl.europa.eu/emeeting/committee/en/agenda/202402/LIBE?meeting=CJ40-2024-0213_1&session=02-13-08-30). Politico has [a cheat sheet on what it all means](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-artificial-intelligence-act-ai-technology-risk-rules/)… in the US, [the Biden-Harris Administration Announces First-Ever Consortium Dedicated to AI Safety](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/biden-harris-administration-announces-first-ever-consortium-dedicated-ai) (which includes civil society voices, praise be)... Japan's ruling party [pushes for AI legislation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/japans-ruling-party-pushes-ai-legislation-within-2024-nikkei-reports-2024-02-15) within 2024, Nikkei reports… the UN Secretary General says [AI must not replace human agency](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1756339741417427409)… and we have a pope (habemus papem!) taking AI seriously according to [recent](https://www.politico.eu/article/meet-the-vatican-ai-mentor-diplomacy-friar-paolo-benanti-pope-francis/) [profiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/world/europe/italy-artificial-intelligence-ethics.html) of his AI advisor. 

We covered AI deepfakes in the context of Taylor Swift [last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/02/05/data-policy-digest). There’s been much more discussion over the last fortnight, with tech giants coming together at the Munich Security Conference to [make pledges](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/16/1232001889/ai-deepfakes-election-tech-accord) around AI-generated deception… the US went into the conference worried that [AI could 'supercharge' election disinformation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-68295845), while Google’s Sundar Pichai said in advance that[ AI can strengthen cyber defences, not just break them down](https://www.ft.com/content/7000ac39-cc0e-467e-96f6-6617f91dc948), and Politico’s preview of the conference noted [‘How tech-savvy civilians became the new masters of war’](https://www.politico.eu/article/war-drones-technology-arms-industry-munich-security-conference-2024/)... 

Politico’s Digital Bridge gave much of its edition last week to the subject, [Deepfake porn is political violence](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/digital-bridge/deepfake-porn-is-political-violence/)… Carnegie Mellon’s Block Center for Technology and Society published [a responsible voter’s guide to genAI and political campaigning](https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/responsible-ai/genai-voterguide/genai-voter-guide.html)… Sadiq Khan told the BBC that [fake AI audio of him nearly led to serious disorder](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68146053)… Faculty’s Angie Ma told UKTN that [AI is a double-edged sword](https://twitter.com/UKTNofficial/status/1757349750683189405) in an election year… Facebook and Instagram are to [label all fake AI images](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68215619), reports the BBC… as Hugging Face publishes [Provenance, Watermarking & Deepfake Detection: Technical tools for more control over non-consensual synthetic content](https://huggingface.co/collections/society-ethics/provenance-watermarking-and-deepfake-detection-65c6792b0831983147bb7578)… the Institute for Strategic Dialogue looked at [‘Spamouflage’](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/pro-ccp-spamouflage-net-work-focuses-on-us-election/) - pro-Chinese attempts to influence the US election… in the US, the FCC has [banned robocalls with AI-generated voices](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24066169/fcc-robocall-ai-voices-ban)… 404 Media used a police report to show [how a high school ‘deepfake nightmare’ unfolded](https://www.404media.co/what-was-she-supposed-to-report-police-report-shows-how-a-high-school-deepfake-nightmare-unfolded/)… Prospect argues that [‘Deepfakes are taking over reality’](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/philosophy/language/64809/deepfakes-are-taking-over-reality)... and BBC News carries a story that [Offenders [are] confused about ethics of AI child sex abuse](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68297336)…

### **DSIT up and take notice**
DSIT celebrated its first birthday with [a cake](https://twitter.com/michelledonelan/status/1755129912019595340)… and reporting on [progress on Science and Technology Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-science-and-technology-framework). DSIT’s most senior civil servant talked to Civil Service World about [setting up the department](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/in-depth/article/dsit-desnz-dbt-perm-secs-interview) (and she’ll be talking to the Strand Group on [‘policy making for the age of AI’](https://thestrandgroup.kcl.ac.uk/event/policy-making-for-the-age-of-ai/) in a few weeks).

While we’re on civil service digital leadership… the [Central Digital and Data Office shakes up leadership as chief exec Lee Devlin to depart](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/cddo-hiring-director-chief-exec-lee-devlin-depart), reports CSW, while the [Scottish Government seeks CTO to ‘set vision and direction for technology strategy](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/02/12/education-and-skills/scottish-government-seeks-cto-to-set-vision-and-direction-for-technology-strategy/). 

But the big news is that, after 9 (NINE) years, [the government has appointed a chief data officer](https://www.government-transformation.com/data/new-chief-data-officer-for-the-uk-government) - [Craig Suckling](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/government-digital-and-data_we-are-pleased-to-announce-that-craig-suckling-activity-7160995653781741568-PUir/), who joins from Amazon Web Services. 

For those of you that haven’t taken an unhealthily close nerdy interest in the CDO saga… former head of GDS Mike Bracken was [made CDO](https://www.cio.com/article/199739/mike-bracken-made-government-chief-data-officer.html) in 2015, but left government a few months later… the [2017 Government Transformation Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy#make-better-use-of-data) promised a CDO by 2020… government [tried hiring a Chief Digital Information Officer](https://www.cio.com/article/195639/uk-government-seeks-its-first-chief-digital-information-officer.html) in 2019… the 2020 [National Data Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy#missions) promised [a chief data officer](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1303613558626955265) (though the details were [silently changed shortly afterwards](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1311570463005564928))... early 2021 brought [a reconfiguration of government digital leadership](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1349015989246177287) and [some initial confusion](https://www.youtube.com/live/0YkNixQPJeY?si=5-EnAoO73n1wgHFq&t=706)… some weirdo did [a sea shanty about the whole thing](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1357320154724589570)… a promise a CDO [would be appointed](https://twitter.com/bryanglick/status/1349024239127584768) became [much less committal](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1368868344099725312) a few months later… there was [another attempt to recruit](https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1519275474693799938) in 2022… and [then again in 2023](https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/07/12/education-and-skills/government-offers-160k-for-chief-data-officer/), which appears to have finally led to an appointment. Let’s hope it doesn’t take them quite as long to actually get anything done.

### **Parly-vous data?**
Both Houses are back from recess - the Commons after a week off, the Lords after a couple of days away.

Let’s start with the Commons… data sharing is one of the main problems in trying to work across government, according to [a new Public Accounts Committee report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmpubacc/75/summary.html) (chair, Meg Hillier, has also [written about it](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/cross-government-working-should-not-be-viewed-as-a-nice-to-have-the-time-for-a-paradigm-shift-is-long-overdue)). 

Coming up… the Levelling Up committee is taking evidence on[ the data-heavy Office for Local Government](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20670)… a subcommittee of the Defence select committee quizzes witnesses on ‘developing AI capacity and expertise in UK Defence’ on [20](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20628) and [27 February](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20629)…  the Transport select committee has an evidence session on [the future of transport data](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20659) on 21 February… there’s an [adjournment debate](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/debates/adjournment/) on [access to social media in prisons](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47012) on 26 February… and DSIT questions take place this Wednesday 21 February (then again on Wednesday 17 April, with Cabinet Office questions next Thursday 29 February and then Thursday 25 April).

In the Lords… DSIT secretary Michelle Donelan and her DG for digital tech and telecoms [gave evidence to the Communications and Digital Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20561/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) on the day the AI white paper response was published (though it was, ironically, beset by tech problems)... government chief scientific adviser, [Professor Dame Angela McLean](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20615), was up in front of the Science and Tech committee a week later… the Lords’ Industry and Regulators Committee published [‘Who watches the watchdogs? Improving the performance, independence and accountability of UK regulators’](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7958/uk-regulators/publications/), which touched on digital skills and overlaps… 

On the floor of the House, there was [a debate on digital exclusion](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2024-02-08a.1808.0)… and discussions on questions from Lord Clement-Jones on [computer misuse and computer evidence](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-02-12/debates/1BC3C04B-657F-4F67-B16F-DDDF8C611B9B/Debate)… Baroness Owen on [AI ‘nudify’ apps](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-02-13/debates/2795CA37-82A5-48CC-B2A7-FF075715DF02/AI%E2%80%9CNudify%E2%80%9DApps)… and Lord Strasburger on [the National Security Online Information Team](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-02-13/debates/14BD56B2-3C94-456F-A6F3-610BBBEBEE90/CombatingDisinformationFreedomOfExpression) (formerly known as the Counter Disinformation Unit) - [Public Technology have a write-up](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/02/15/defence-and-security/worrying-overreach-a-new-name-but-ministers-bat-off-familiar-questions-over-anti-disinformation-unit/) and [Big Brother Watch a thread](https://twitter.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1757440765247246481)…

And there are [evidence sessions](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8163/the-future-of-news-impartiality-trust-and-technology) coming (20 and 27 February, 5 March) on the Communications and Digital Committee’s [future of news](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20678) inquiry… and the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy is launching [a new inquiry into Defending Democracy](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/111/national-security-strategy-joint-committee/news/199739/jcnss-launches-inquiry-on-defending-democracy-with-uk-election-expected-this-year/), which of course includes some questions on AI - you have until 18 March (h/t [Tom King](https://twitter.com/Acertaintom)). 

### **Labour movement**
Shadow DSIT secretary [Peter Kyle was visiting tech companies](https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1757129783522034124) in the US (the full list is at the end of [the press release](https://policymogul.com/key-updates/34394/labour-s-peter-kyle-meets-with-leading-tech-companies-in-the-united-states-to-drum-up-investment-in-the-uk) - the US does have some great civil society orgs and academic research centres too, you know).

Shadow science minister [Chi Onwurah told OpenUK’s State of Open Conference](https://openuk.uk/press-posts/labour-frontbencher-advocates-for-open-source-software-and-regulatory-innovation/) that regulation can support rather than stifle innovation, and ‘A Labour government would urgently introduce binding regulation of a small group of companies developing the most powerful AI models’. (You can [watch the whole conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0U2cL1JGPZfPFtalGrpXbPEbskbrYC-g), read a [summary](https://openuk.uk/soocon24-wrapup/), and check out the other keynotes from [Conservative Baroness (Tina) Stowell](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4171525/open-source-ai-future-lords-committee) and [Cambridge academic Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/2024/02/09/the-sorcerors-apprentice), too.)

There are also some titbits on policy priorities in this BBC article, [Labour works on plan for power](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68205102) - not forgetting[ LabourList has a summary of the full National Policy Forum document](https://labourlist.org/2023/10/labour-national-policy-forum-final-document-summary-policy-manifesto-party-conference/) from a few months ago. 

And the first hustings took place in [the Welsh Labour leadership contest](https://action.labour.org.uk/page/141132/action/1?locale=en-GB).

### **On the Horizon**
[Horizon: Ministers to work with Fujitsu on compensation costs but has no plans for law to tell citizens of government IT errors](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/02/05/public-order-justice-and-rights/horizon-ministers-to-work-with-fujitsu-on-compensation-costs-but-has-no-plans-for-law-to-tell-citizens-of-government-it-errors) (Public Technology)...

Oh and just when you thought things might have quietened down a bit… yesterday’s Sunday Times: [Post Office boss: I was told to stall compensation to help Tories](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/3ff6af62-c5f0-42d6-b180-d60960b31be7?shareToken=6c820a4d69bd21ec96674ff1604f6218).
