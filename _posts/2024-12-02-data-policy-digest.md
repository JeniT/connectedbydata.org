Hello, and welcome to our 27th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments.

The world has changed somewhat since our last edition just over a month ago. 

Yes, the Data (Use and Access) Bill has started its parliamentary journey proper. 

And there was some big electoral event in the US, global ramifications, end of the world, blah blah blah. More on those stories, and much more, below.

I’ve tried using AI to help compile this edition for the first time (formatting hyperlinks rather than anything more taxing), with some mixed results - it saved some time, but it skipped some links and renamed others. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence it watered down some of the headlines that were most critical of AI…. (Coincidentally, Rachel Coldicutt has just written about [how people are using genAI at work](https://buttondown.com/justenoughinternet/archive/fomo-is-not-a-strategy/).)

Speaking of playing around with the newsletter… **we’d love to get your feedback on the Digest**. What do you like? What don’t you like? Now’s your chance to tell us via [this form](https://forms.gle/R9gHgFePV8Ypzge17) - all thoughts very gratefully received. 

And… if you’re free next Monday 9 December, we have [some festive drinks](https://lu.ma/x2wilt4d) for participants and friends of the Data and AI Civil Society Network, partner organisations and other friends.

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**. We’re on Bluesky [@connectedbydata.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.bsky.social), and Mastodon [@ConnectedByData@social.coop](http://social.coop/@ConnectedByData). You can also **[catch up on previous Digests](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-data-policy-digest)**.

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}
**Data (Use and Access) Bill (DUAB):** 19 November was the Second Reading in the Lords for the [Data (Use and Access) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825) - the first chance for [peers to properly debate](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/november/lords-debates-data-use-and-access-bill/) the substance of the Bill, a debate you can [read in Hansard](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-11-19/debates/6B196F71-312C-4957-AF14-98B66C5DBEE4/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)) or [watch back](https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/4bc930ca-f81e-4928-a11d-f9d942014004?in=17:02:05). The government has also published [supporting docs](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-use-and-access-bill), though not yet a Keeling schedule, which shows how the Bill will change existing laws - legal consultancy Handley Gill have [stepped into that breach](https://www.handleygill.co.uk/handley-gill-blog/keeping-on-keeling).

The next stage is committee, where the [Lords will go through it line-by-line](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/november/data-use-and-access-bill-faces-first-checks-in-lords/): dates for that are [3, 10, 16 and 18 December](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19280). As with the predecessor Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, it’s [Grand Committee](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62fe365fe90e0703e1bb4844/2022-08_Guide_to_Making_Legislation_-_master_version__4_.pdf#page=256) - that means [amendments (which are already appearing](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/publications)) will not be voted on and only made if agreed unanimously, otherwise they’ll be withdrawn and no doubt reappear at a future stage - and we have the [rough order for what will be debated when](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-11-19/debates/6B196F71-312C-4957-AF14-98B66C5DBEE4/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)#contribution-7710CF84-D288-42EB-AE04-4823D5C20ADC).

Before the debate, there were published briefings from various members of the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) - which now has a working group dedicated to the Bill ([scroll down](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) for details) - including [us](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tfAEPnHWWZImo4Bw4aiACHHH9aKNPSiuf1wiK4PYt50/edit?usp=sharing)… [ORG](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/data-use-and-access-bill-will-fail-to-protect-public-from-ai-harms/) (who’ve also started [a petition about the Bill](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/ai-says-no-tell-keir-starmer-that-people-not-machines-should-oversee-life-changing-decisions))… [Big Brother Watch](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Big-Brother-Watchs-Briefing-on-the-Data-Use-and-Access-Bill-2024.pdf)… [Defend Digital Me](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/11/17/data-use-and-access-bill-our-view-and-call-to-action/)… [ODI](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/data-success-use-and-access-what-parliament-needs-to-consider-for-the-data-use-and-access-bill/)… [medConfidential](https://medconfidential.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/data-uses.pdf)… [Careful Industries](https://labourlist.org/2024/10/government-news-smart-data-bill/)… [5Rights](https://5rightsfoundation.com/resource/briefing-on-the-second-reading-of-the-data-use-and-access-bill/)… our resource page on [the old Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://connectedbydata.org/topics/dpdi-bill) may also be of interest…

On subjects covered by the Bill… the Lords Constitution committee is still [less than delighted](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldconst/40/4002.htm) with some of the powers being given to ministers and lack of scrutiny (the Bingham Centre also take [a look at delegated powers in the Bill](https://binghamcentre.biicl.org/comments/138/clauses-70-and-71-of-the-new-data-use-and-access-bill-will-we-see-a-different-approach-to-delegated-powers-in-the-new-parliament))… Peter Kyle [responded to the Lords European Affairs Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/45746/documents/226396/default/) on their data adequacy concerns… he also spoke to the Express about the [National Underground Asset Register](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1979875/incredible-new-live-map-of) (DSIT have published [a project update on that](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-underground-asset-register-project-update-november-2024))… [Ofcom has launched a call for evidence on Researchers’ access to information from regulated online services](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/call-for-evidence-researchers-access-to-information-from-regulated-online-services/) (closes 17 January), while the European Commission are also exploring the topic as [part of the Digital Services Act](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13817-Delegated-Regulation-on-data-access-provided-for-in-the-Digital-Services-Act_en)... and lots from DSIT on digital identity, including [Digital identity services: inclusion monitoring report findings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-services-inclusion-monitoring-report-findings) and [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework: supporting documents](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-supporting-documents)…

On subjects people might like to see in the Bill, or tried getting into its predecessor… [UK government failing to list use of AI on mandatory register](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/uk-government-failing-to-list-use-of-ai-on-mandatory-register) (The Guardian) - they’re apparently (still) coming [‘SOON’](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-11-18/14587) - but [does the current hub page give us some clues?](https://bsky.app/profile/gavinfreeguard.bsky.social/post/3lc374tv7h223) ([It might not!](https://bsky.app/profile/whitingx.bsky.social/post/3lc3hfvhmb22l))...

**AI Bill:** As per the last Digest: A narrow frontier-focused Bill, putting the AI Safety Institute on a statutory footing and making voluntary agreements between government and industry mandatory, is expected soon, accompanied by a consultation (which we understand may go wider).

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill:** [Coming in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill). Meanwhile… [Major Incident Declared at Merseyside Hospital After Cyberattack](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/major-incident-declared-merseyside-hospital-30450814) (Liverpool Echo)...

**Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill:** Well here’s a treat for parliamentary nerds (yes I know I need to get out more, thank you): since this is [a Law Commission Bill](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn07156/) (one brought following recommendations of the statutory, independent Commission), there’s a slightly different procedure. The first proper chance to debate the contents was at a [Second Reading Committee](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-11-06/debates/3FEB0846-1D4D-4CD3-A53A-78D482D03137/Property(DigitalAssetsEtc)Bill) (before a perfunctory [second reading](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-11-13/debates/4CD8565C-8534-45E2-BCF7-ED1CCDD9C66A/Property(DigitalAssetsEtc)Bill(HL))), and it now goes to a [Special Public Bill Committee](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5486/special-public-bill-committee) which will take evidence, [which started on 26 November](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/746/property-digital-assets-etc-bill-hl-special-public-bill-committee/events/) (next hearing: 5 December). The [Lords Library](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0062/) and [Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/Topics/Private-client/Whats-changing/Property-Digital-Assets-etc-Bill) have briefings.

**Other King’s Speech Bills:** [Product Regulation and Metrology Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3752) is in Lords Committee stage… the [Employment Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3737) is in Commons committee, as the Business and Trade Select Committee [launches an inquiry into it](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-and-trade-committee/news/203543/btc-launches-major-new-inquiry-into-flagship-employment-rights-bill/), and the [Regulatory Policy Committee rated the government’s impact assessments about it red](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-rights-bill-rpc-opinion-red-rated) (eight of 23 were ‘not fit for purpose’).

**Online Safety Act:** As per, the Online Safety Act Network newsletter ([they’ve had two since our last Digest](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=8569c2a50489c6ef87ca271f2&id=6f3bd44856)) will have much more, but a few things we’ve spotted include…

**Private Member’s Bills:** Josh McAllister’s [Protection of Children (Digital Safety and Data Protection)](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3778) Bill has its Second Reading in March - though Sky News reports that [a plan to ban smartphones in schools has been dropped](https://news.sky.com/story/school-smartphone-ban-will-not-become-law-after-mp-drops-proposal-sky-news-understands-13245379). (There’s also [this from the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce89edg8j0yo) which refers to a possible Bill on banning smartphones but it’s unclear which one.)

**Other:** [Bishops seek talks over ‘left-field’ proposal to abolish the Lords Spiritual](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2024/1-november/news/uk/bishops-seek-talks-over-left-field-proposal-to-abolish-the-lords-spiritual) (Church Times).


### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}
**Budget:** Not long after our last Digest went to pixel, the Chancellor rendered it instantly outdated with [the first Budget from a Labour Government in 14 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-2024). I tried to summarise [what it had to say about data and AI for the ODI](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/budget-2024-what-does-it-say-about-data-and-ai/); there was reaction from [IFOW](https://www.ifow.org/news-articles/ifow-response-to-autumn-budget-2024) and [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/resource/the-autumn-budget-2024-what-s-in-it-for-tech.html); DSIT focused on R&D investment in [a press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-backs-uk-rd-with-record-204-billion-investment-at-autumn-budget); Public Technology had more on [DSIT’s role ensuring a ‘coherent’ approach to digital](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/10/31/economics-and-finance/budget-dsit-input-to-ensure-spending-review-delivers-centralised-and-coherent-approach-to-digital-investment/) in the spending review (coming in [June](https://www.ft.com/content/edc2455b-95c0-4994-9a2d-1a41ad41ef80), [apparently](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/28/rachel-reeves-may-wait-until-june-to-announce-whitehall-budget-details)); there are terms of reference for the [Review of Technology Adoption for Growth, Innovation and Productivity](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terms-of-reference-for-the-review-of-technology-adoption) announced in the Budget; and here’s the [now-concluded consultation on open data for road fuel prices](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/empowering-drivers-and-boosting-competition-in-the-road-fuel-retail-market) the Budget referenced.

**The traditional centre:** Let’s stick with the Treasury, since it’s still a relevant novelty that they’re thinking about data, tech and AI… Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ [Mansion House speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/mansion-house-2024-speech) talked a bit about harnessing digital technology (and listening to business - [here’s a reminder of the Civil Society Covenant](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/the-governments-plan-to-improve-civil-servicecharity-relations-is-cause-for-excitement), chancellor - which [NCVO are doing some work on](https://www.ncvo.org.uk/get-involved/civil-society-covenant/)) and working with President-Elect Trump on emerging technologies (Politico suggests a [‘mini-trade deal’](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-us-trade-war-uk-tariffs-harley-davidson-motorbike-jack-daniels-ready-to-go/) is being discussed in Whitehall, and innovation and tech was also in the PM’s [message of congratulations](https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1854076601811570883))… it also mentioned [digital gilts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/uk-plans-trial-to-issue-blockchain-based-gilts-within-two-years) (blockchain klaxon! Remember blockchain?)... the Treasury’s [newly-published areas of research interest](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-treasury-areas-of-research-interest) include novel data sources, emerging tech including AI, and citizen engagement… the Council for Science and Technology [wrote to the Chancellor](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-the-chancellor-on-scale-up-finance-for-innovative-science-and-technology-companies)… and [‘CDDO and Treasury develop AI investment metrics for spending review’](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/11/20/economics-and-finance/cddo-and-treasury-develop-ai-investment-metrics-for-spending-review/), reports Public Technology…

**States of play:** You may have noticed there was an election in the US, and that [former President Donald Trump emerged victorious](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election).

Everyone is scrabbling to understand what that might mean for… well, everything, including tech, data and AI.  We had this on the Republican election platform [back in July](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/07/19/data-policy-digest):

In its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing’… this is apparently part of championing innovation, which also includes opposing the Democrats’ ‘unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown’, and opposing a central bank digital currency…*

It may also be worth checking out [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) - the Presidential Transition Project - whose [‘Mandate for Leadership’](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) has a good few references to AI and tech.
