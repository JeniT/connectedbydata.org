### **Deeply DPDIB** {#deeply-dpdib}

**In the House **As of 8.16pm last Wednesday, 24 April, the Bill has finished Lords Committee Stage after seven days of debate. It’s [Lords Report Stage](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/commons/coms-lords-report-stage/) next - date tbc - when we can expect lots of amendments to return and to be voted upon (in this committee stage, only amendments agreed unanimously would be made, with no votes permitted).

We summarised the amendments raised in [the first three days last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/04/03/data-policy-digest) - here’s what’s happened since:

[On the fourth day](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-15/debates/84830FA4-3B3D-4934-A8D8-869516B0C0CE/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) (15 April), amendments covered transfers of personal data to third countries… access to data for researchers (previously raised during the Online Safety Act and based on provisions in the EU)… national security exemptions (concerns they breach ECHR)… processing of data by the police for submission to the Crown Prosecution Service… the role, duties and objectives of the Information Commissioner… code of practice on EdTech… government amendments on transfers of personal data to third countries for the purposes of law enforcement; some third party country amendments with consequential and transitional provisions; and some technical amendments… government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn.

[On the fifth day](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-04-17/debates/D7D6616F-4588-4AF9-A699-18D0582CB981/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) (17 April), amendments covered complaints from data subjects (including the ability for organisations to bring complaints on behalf of subjects)… Digital Verification Services (and digital identity theft)… a ‘slightly disparate group’ including data on climate and energy, and risks to data adequacy… oversight of biometric data… some technical amendments from government, and on the relationship between UK- and EU-derived pieces of legislation… government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn.

[On the sixth day](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-22/debates/B0FACBA7-F69A-4D92-9C2A-6DA5FBCC8385/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) (22 April), amendments covered cookies… nuisance calls and spam texts… democratic engagement (use of data by political parties and others, specifically the soft opt-in)… power to require information for social security purposes (DWP powers)… government technical amendments… government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn. 

And on[ the seventh day](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-24/debates/9BA1A8E3-48E3-4472-AF8E-2EFAFC53E605/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill) (24 April), the Lords ended the work they had done, considering amendments on the power to require information for social security purposes (DWP powers)… registers of births and deaths (standardisation and a move to a single digital register) and expanding the [Tell Us Once](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once) service to private companies… evidence from computer records (the ‘Mr Bates amendment’)… Information Commission (including appointments and functions)… AI-generated child sexual abuse material… deepfakes… risks to genomic data… while groups with government amendments covered the National Underground Asset Register… the Information Commission… power to make amendments… extent of the bill… a [Camrose/Kidron amendment](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/18402/amendments/10013043) allowing coroners to require information from tech companies regardless of the cause of a child’s death (it had, controversially, been limited to suicide)... government amendments accepted, all other amendments withdrawn. 

There’s also [a ‘will write’ letter](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications) from Viscount Camrose, which covers various issues raised during earlier days of debate.

The debates are well worth reading (no, really) for the ‘vigorous—I think that is the right word—scrutiny’ (minister, Viscount Camrose) of the Bill, and to see just how bad the Bill is. To take just one example: on Wednesday, on DWP powers, [Baroness Sherlock](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-24/debates/9BA1A8E3-48E3-4472-AF8E-2EFAFC53E605/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill#contribution-148C98D3-1C3F-4210-9BB0-A60E92B0F21D) thought the minister was ‘saying that the Bill would allow the DWP to request information from any kind of organisation’, not just financial institutions currently specified, ‘including phone companies… By virtue of further regulations, could they extend that to anything—to Garmin, the people who monitor your runs, to gyms and to anyone else? Is that correct?’ 

The minister, Viscount Younger, confirmed this was indeed correct. He ‘hope[d] indeed that it provides some reassurance that extending it to the banks and financial institutions initially is deliberately designed to be narrow’ - it would be for future parliamentary debate to decide whether to use the power to designate further third parties. But we shouldn’t be concerned: [he argued](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-24/debates/9BA1A8E3-48E3-4472-AF8E-2EFAFC53E605/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill#contribution-526D9EC6-E5D5-4C1A-A67D-D3887F302EF3) ‘this is not a surveillance power and suggesting that it is simply causes unnecessary worry’. So that’s ok, then.[ ](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-24/debates/9BA1A8E3-48E3-4472-AF8E-2EFAFC53E605/DataProtectionAndDigitalInformationBill#contribution-526D9EC6-E5D5-4C1A-A67D-D3887F302EF3)

A code of practice for those powers might also not be forthcoming before Lords Report stage. Lib Dem Lord Clement-Jones, noting it has already been ‘quite a marathon’, hoped ‘Report is not too early as there is a lot to sort out.’ As Viscount Camrose put it, ‘We have not necessarily agreed on a great deal’. ‘Understatement’ is one word that comes to mind. (There are others.)

**Out of the House… DWP powers** Big Brother Watch have been busy, commissioning legal advice from [Matrix](https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/resource/legal-opinion-on-proposed-financial-surveillance-powers-in-data-protection-and-digital-information-bill/) - [GOVERNMENT’S NEW BANK SPYING POWERS “BREACH PRIVACY RIGHTS”, WARN LAWYERS](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/press-releases/governments-new-bank-spying-powers-breach-privacy-rights-warn-lawyers/) - and with a thread (with video) on [day six of the debate](https://twitter.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1782440955062190523)… there’s been coverage of the controversial clauses elsewhere, including [DWP recruiting 'covert surveillance officers' to snoop on benefit claimants: 'I fear for the future'](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/dwp-surveillance-officers-benefit-fraud-crackdown/) (Big Issue)...

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}
As if that weren’t enough...

**AI Bill?** Is the UK government changing its mind on the need for legislation? The FT reports that [UK rethinks AI legislation as alarm grows over potential risks](https://www.ft.com/content/311b29a4-bbb3-435b-8e82-ae19f2740af9), and Bloomberg that [UK Starts Drafting AI Regulations for Most Powerful Models](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-15/uk-starts-drafting-ai-regulations-for-most-powerful-models?s=03), though the government denies a change in approach.

It’s [third reading next](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-24/debates/F64DEE94-D7AA-4D2C-BD99-F4EED4BAFC58/ArtificialIntelligence(Regulation)Bill(HL)), on [10 May](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal47842), for the actually existing AI BIll - Lord Holmes’ [Private Members’](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/private-members/) effort (they tend not to pass).

And… we were part of [the TUC’s project to draft an AI (Employment and Regulation) Bill](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/ai-bill-project).

**Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act** One of the other digital bills under this government, which received [Royal Assent back in December 2022](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3069).

**Online Safety Act** Discussions of a possible ban on smartphones for children continue to generate headlines… [GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING BAN ON MOBILE PHONE SALES TO UNDER 16-YEAR-OLDS](https://order-order.com/2024/04/09/exclusive-government-considering-ban-on-mobile-phone-sales-to-under-16-year-olds/) (Guido Fawkes) - [Politico reported earlier this month that](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/london-playbook-pm-no-ass-kissing-but-a-polite-ask-from-dc-in-dc/) a government aide says that won’t happen ‘although a discussion is ongoing about increasing parental empowerment on smartphone use’...

**Criminal Justice Bill** This awaits a date for Commons report stage… [Creating sexually explicit deepfakes to become a criminal offence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68823042) (BBC)... a reminder that Labour has recently [urged Rishi Sunak to close legal loophole on deepfake pornography](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/deepfake-porn-creation-labour-party-b2517172.html) (Independent) and called for [a ban on nudification apps](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/17/ai-deepfakes-misinformation-nudification-labour). 

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill** [The Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/stages) is now in ping-pong, with the Commons first considering amendments from the Lords on 30 April. (On 22 April, there was [a ‘carry over’ motion](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/86885/Html?subType=Standard#_idTextAnchor005) - this means the Bill can continue its parliamentary journey until December if need be.)  

More broadly… in [Opening remarks at the American Bar Association (ABA) Chair’s Showcase on AI Foundation Models](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/opening-remarks-at-the-american-bar-association-aba-chairs-showcase-on-ai-foundation-models), the chair of the CMA said the [UK has real concerns about AI risks, says competition regulator](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/11/uk-has-real-concerns-about-ai-risks-says-competition-regulator) (Guardian - see also [Politico ](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/04/uks-competition-watchdog-puts-big-tech-on-notice-over-ai-deals-00151740)for subscribers)...

And a story in three acts… **Act One** [Microsoft-OpenAI deal set to dodge formal EU merger probe, sources say](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsofts-13-bln-openai-deal-avoid-formal-eu-probe-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-04-17/) (Reuters)... **Act Two** [Exclusive: Microsoft's OpenAI partnership could face EU antitrust probe, sources say](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsofts-openai-partnership-could-face-eu-antitrust-probe-sources-say-2024-04-18/) (Reuters)... **Act Three** [CMA seeks views on AI partnerships and other arrangements](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-seeks-views-on-ai-partnerships-and-other-arrangements) (CMA)...

And… UK in a Changing Europe’s latest [‘divergence tracker’](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/reports/uk-eu-divergence-tracker-q1-2024/) touches on the EU Digital Markets Act. 

**[Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3508)** This [received Royal Assent](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-04-25/debates/4970871C-8678-404B-BF77-C5883CF40477/RoyalAssent) on Thursday 25 April - it now becomes law. (Worth noting that a [report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/lddelreg/100/10002.htm) from the Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee had disagreed with the government’s plan to use a negative resolution - becomes law unless a motion rejects it - instead of affirmative - must be actively approved by both Houses to come into effect - on information gathering powers.)

Shall we start with AI, for a change?

In [an interview with The I](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-no-contact-trump-close-biden-labour-3003244), Labour leader Keir Starmer said:
> “People tend to fall into two camps with AI. They either look at the opportunities or look at the threat. I’m in the first camp – so I look at the opportunities. I think the opportunities are profound”.

> He insisted he supported the Prime Minister’s initiatives to unite governments around a regulatory framework, saying it is important to ensure that AI will “develop in a way which is in the interest of all communities, and everybody within the UK”. But he concluded: “There’s no question now of putting the genie back in the bottle.”
