Hello, and welcome to our 25th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments.

Ah, autumn. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness - and unhealthy, underwhelming beige buffet bites and warm white wine. Yes, several of us are heading up to Liverpool for Labour Party conference this weekend - if you are too, [check out our spreadsheet of data and AI events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbZlT1ColiwokPdVgaSXhtF5tyw8FBRehEyuAWlhXto/edit?usp=sharing), or [drop me a line](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com) if you’d like to meet up.

It’ll be fashionable to be early - we may have a government minister for you if you’re there at 6…

Three other forthcoming events to flag:
* TODAY If you’re in New York - the Liverpool of the Hudson - then Tim is talking about [options for a global citizens assembly on AI at TechSalon New York](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-09-20-tech-salon-nyc-global-deliberation-ai), ahead of the Civil Society Days of the UN Summit of the Future

## **Data policy developments** {#data-policy-developments}

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}
**Digital Information and Smart Data Bill (DISD, which we’re pronouncing ‘dissed’)** This may appear in the autumn. Diginomica have [three](https://diginomica.com/data-protection-what-might-uks-legislative-plans-be) [preview](https://diginomica.com/data-protection-conflicting-priorities-could-spell-policy-disaster) [pieces](https://diginomica.com/data-protection-uks-ico-speaks-out-government-plans), while [CILIP](https://www.cilip.org.uk/news/681101/CILIP-writes-to-Secretary-of-State.htm) (the library and information association) and digital identity company [Yoti](https://www.yoti.com/blog/yotis-key-recommendations-for-the-digital-information-and-smart-data-bill/) have written to the Secretary of State and made some recommendations, respectively.

We expect digital identity verification services will be in the Bill. Those feature in Careful Industries’ new report, [Digital Identity in the UK: A Rapid Response Study](https://www.careful.industries/digital-identity-in-the-uk). Jake Richards MP has also written [Digital ID: Empowering Citizens and Transforming Public Services](https://www.progressivebritain.org/digital-id-empowering-citizens-and-transforming-public-services/) for Progressive Britain… while DSIT has published guidance on how to [Join the register of digital identity and attribute services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/join-the-register-of-digital-identity-and-attribute-services) and [Enabling the use of digital identities in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-identity).

Some other bits and pieces relevant to things that might be in the Bill… [NatWest Group has joined the Open Property Data Association (OPDA)](https://www.mpamag.com/uk/mortgage-industry/technology/natwest-is-latest-major-lender-to-join-opda/505160) (Mortgage Introducer, in their first appearance in the Digest)... [Evaluating browser-based cookie setting options](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluating-browser-based-cookie-setting-options) (DSIT).

Also, while we’re on big government data initiatives… I have been remiss in somehow not linking to various relevant pieces on the National Data Library - I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever laid before me - so… [The new UK Government wants a National Data Library: a brilliant aspiration, if built on solid foundations](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/the-new-uk-government-wants-a-national-data-library-a-brilliant-aspiration-if-built-on-solid-foundations/) (ADR UK)... [Data Sharing Infrastructure](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/data-sharing-infrastructure/) (Digital Twin Hub)... [Towards a new Data for London Library](https://chiefdigitalofficer4london.medium.com/towards-a-new-data-for-london-library-d95a062f30d9) (Theo Blackwell)...

And I may well be reading too much into this, on algorithmic transparency (which peers tried to add to the previous Data Bill), but… GOV.UK suggests that [the page of Algorithmic Transparency Records](https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records) has been updated; there do not appear to be any new entries; but there are several organisations now listed in the navigation bit on the left, despite not having any records yet. We’re expecting new records to be published soon - does this give us a clue as to which organisations are about to publish something?

**AI Bill** We’re waiting for this one as well. There’ll be a few discussions on AI in the Lords over the next few weeks (see Parly-vous data, below).

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill** [ICO and NCA sign memorandum of understanding for further collaboration on cyber security](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/09/ico-and-nca-sign-memorandum-of-understanding-for-further-collaboration-on-cyber-security/) (ICO)...

[TfL writes to 5,000 cyber attack customers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgvxqdznjqo) (BBC)... [UK convenes global coalition to boost cyber skills and tackle growing threats](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-convenes-global-coalition-to-boost-cyber-skills-and-tackle-growing-threats) (DSIT).

**Other King’s Speech Bills** The [Product Safety and Metrology Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3752) will have its second reading in the Lords on 8 October. The Regulatory Policy Committee have [rated the impact assessment green](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-regulation-and-metrology-bill-impact-assessment-rpc-opinion-green-rated).

**Online Safety Act** [Crackdown on intimate image abuse as government strengthens online safety laws](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crackdown-on-intimate-image-abuse-as-government-strengthens-online-safety-laws) (DSIT, MoJ, Home Office)... [‘Small but risky’ online services under the Online Safety Act: letter from DSIT Secretary of State](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/small-but-risky-online-services-under-the-online-safety-act-letter-from-dsit-secretary-of-state) (DSIT)... more on smartphones, in the UK ([Academy chain with 35,000 pupils to be first in England to go phone-free](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/sep/13/academy-chain-with-35000-pupils-to-be-first-in-england-to-go-phone-free), The Guardian), Belgium ([Belgian schools launch crackdown on smartphones](https://www.politico.eu/article/classroom-smartphone-ban-schools-belgium-mental-health-screen-time-apps-technology), Politico) and Australia ([Labor’s plan [Australia] to ban children from social media might actually create more harm, charity says](https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/sep/12/australia-plan-to-ban-children-from-social-media-might-actually-create-more-harm-charity-says), The Guardian)... 

While the [Online Safety Act Network newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/3d818ad16b77/osa-network-online-safety-newsletter-17424857?e=12547a4002) returns after a summer break, and the Network’s [Maeve Walsh is profiled as ‘the “civil servant in the wild” who fought for the Online Safety Act’](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/in-depth/article/meet-maeve-walsh-the-civil-servant-in-the-wild-who-fought-for-the-online-safety-act) by Civil Service World.

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act** Business and Trade Minister Justin Madders made a statement to the House on [the timetable for implementing the Bill](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-09-09/hcws74).

**Private Member’s Bills** See Parly-vous data, below, for more on PMBs in the Commons (we know the 20 MPs who were drawn, but not yet what they’ll introduce) and Lords (Lord Clement-Jones on public sector algorithms and Baroness Owen on Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Images and Videos).

**Other** The commencement of the [Procurement Act will be delayed](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-09-12/hcws90) from October to February, while ‘a new National Procurement Policy Statement that clearly sets out this Government’s priorities for public procurement in support of our missions’. That came from Cabinet Office minister, Georgia Gould, who was previously leader of Camden - might be a good moment to gen up on [a report by UCL’s IIPP on mission-driven procurement there](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2024/jul/mission-led-procurement-and-market-shaping-lessons-camden-council). 

### **DSIT up and take notice** {#dsit-up-and-take-notice}
Let’s start at the conventional centre of government: there are continued controversies around the Downing Street operation, as [Starmer defended Sue Gray after reports of No 10 rifts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g559jvp77o) (BBC) even before [All The Salary Fallout](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxgdgkew81o); there have been some significant appointments, with a [Head of Mission Delivery Unit appointed](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/clara-swinson-mission-delivery-unit-head-appointed) (CSW), [Sir Michael Barber appointed as adviser to the Prime Minister](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sir-michael-barber-appointed-as-adviser-to-the-prime-minister) (10 Downing Street - [more from CSW](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/starmer-appoints-delivery-guru-michael-barber-for-missions-drive), [some](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/case%20study%20psas.pdf) [old](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/report/whitehall-monitor-deep-impact) IfG reports give a quick rundown on the Public Service Agreements associated with Barber, while Claire Melamed wrote about  [what government can learn from how schools use data for impact](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/government-data/) in measuring missions for the Bennett Institute), and several MPs (including a few on the digital/data side) made [‘mission champions’](https://x.com/patrickkmaguire/status/1834270020727181485) (Stian Westlake also has [Some thoughts on research & innovation capacity to deliver Government missions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16S9bSuj1UcXvYU07aCBajGYt6jQKnAKib_N4RQV0r6U/edit?pli=1)); and [Treasury guidance recommends ‘light touch’ business case for digital projects](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/09/02/government-and-politics/treasury-guidance-recommends-light-touch-business-case-for-digital-projects/) (Public Technology). 

DSIT ministers have been busy: Peter Kyle gave a speech at [the Campaign for Science and Engineering Conference](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/peter-kyles-speech-at-the-campaign-for-science-and-engineering-conference) (and also joked with Research Professional News that he [’wouldn’t wish a doctorate on my worst enemy!’](https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-uk-politics-2024-9-peter-kyle-i-wouldn-t-wish-a-doctorate-on-my-worst-enemy/)), Chris Bryant gave [a speech at Connected Britain 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/sir-chris-bryant-speech-at-connected-britain-2024), while Feryal Clark was [in Brazil for the G20 meeting](https://www.g20.org/en/news/brasil-bets-on-digital-inclusion-to-reduce-inequalities) on the digital economy, which produced [this ministerial declaration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g20-ministerial-declaration-maceio-13-september-2024/g20-ministerial-declaration-13-september-2024). Elsewhere, former DSIT policy adviser, [Ben Johnson, spoke to The Entrepreneurs Network](https://entrepreneursnetwork.substack.com/p/mission-possible) on ‘bridging government and innovation networks to seize the UK’s edge in science and technology’.

The move of GDS, CDDO and i.AI to DSIT continues to attract coverage: [‘Really powerful’ – GDS boss welcomes move to policy department](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/09/11/education-and-skills/really-powerful-gds-boss-welcomes-move-to-policy-department/) (Public Technology), while the latest print edition of Civil Service World looks at [the new digital centre of government](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/in-depth/article/read-the-autumn-2024-issue-of-civil-service-world) and how the MHRA is using AI.

### **Parly-vous data?** {#parly-vous-data}
Parliament crammed a fair bit into the two weeks between summer recess and conference recess. 

The Commons came back to [a debate on technology in public services on Monday 2 September](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-09-02/debates/721F0511-796C-49C4-A4FF-E0528E6419C6/TechnologyInPublicServices). It was an odd debate, in that there were several [maiden speeches](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/maiden-speech/) which (while interesting and often moving) didn’t necessarily focus on the task in hand (Labour’s Allison Gardner was an exception) and the Tory frontbench spent a lot of time on controversial civil service appointments (even [prompting a Lib Dem MP to intervene](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-09-02/debates/721F0511-796C-49C4-A4FF-E0528E6419C6/TechnologyInPublicServices#contribution-19FD6227-9B5D-4384-B26C-3CF6A8C1EA03)). But there were some interesting passages in between the rhetoric you may already have heard from the new government, such as a (tiny) bit more detail on the National Data Library and a nice passage from Peter Kyle on how nothing is inevitable and we can shape the future ([a point we’ve made in the past](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision)). [I tried live-tweeting](https://bsky.app/profile/gavinfreeguard.bsky.social/post/3l36wexpjyd2v) (on Bluesky), while the ODI [have a summary](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/mps-debate-technology-in-public-services-on-the-first-day-back/).

Other major Commons developments included [the election of select committee chairs](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/september/select-committee-chair-elections/). [Chi Onwurah beat Labour colleague Dawn Butler](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-innovation-and-technology-committee/news/202851/chi-onwurah-elected-as-chair-of-science-innovation-and-technology-committee/) to chair the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee ([Labour tech stalwart Chi Onwurah to chair DSIT committee](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/09/17/government-and-politics/labour-tech-stalwart-chi-onwurah-to-chair-dsit-committee/) is how Public Technology wrote it up), while other particularly relevant results include Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Con) chairing the powerful [Public Accounts Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee/news/202843/sir-geoffrey-cliftonbrown-elected-chair-of-the-public-accounts-committee/), Simon Hoare (Con) chairing [Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/327/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/news/202841/simon-hoare-elected-chair-of-the-public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/), Liam Byrne (Lab) chairing [Business and Trade](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-and-trade-committee/news/202803/liam-byrne-elected-as-chair-of-business-and-trade-committee/), and Caroline Dinenage (Con) remaining chair of [Culture, Media and Sport](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/378/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/202818/caroline-dinenage-elected-as-chair-of-culture-media-and-sport-committee/). Members will be elected - within each party, according to the allocations which are based on the general election result - at some point.

The Commons also had their ballot for Private Member’s Bills, with [20 MPs being drawn](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/september/private-members-bill-ballot-to-be-drawn-on-thursday-5-september/). They’ll be thinking about what they’d like to put in their bills, which will be introduced on Wednesday 16 October. And on 11 September, there was a ministerial statement on the [Government response to the Law Commission’s report on Digital Assets](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-09-11/hcws84).

The Lords have also been busy… 3 September: Communications and Digital Committee [hearing on digital competition](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21896/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/), and [a debate on the first report from the Covid Inquiry](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-03/debates/42A05971-118A-4877-A8ED-7D1AEC54F5F2/Covid-19Inquiry)_ _which included some mentions of data… 4 September: a riot-related question from Lord Sikka (Lab) where [debate touched on online misinformation](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-04/debates/D2ED9051-318B-4FF9-9601-E6DE4DBEF153/SocialDisorder)… 5 September: a question on the [Ability of current online safety legislation to regulate abuse, including racism, islamophobia, homophobia, and sectarianism, on social media platforms](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-05/debates/4892D2A4-9682-4A59-B92E-64340BE6AEA3/OnlineSafetyLegislationAbuseOnSocialMedia) from Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick (Lab)... 6 September: the introduction of (Con) Baroness (Charlotte) Owen’s [Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Images and Videos (Offences) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3759) (she spoke to [Channel 4 News](https://www.channel4.com/news/former-johnson-aide-baroness-owen-wants-law-to-ban-deepfake-porn))... 9 September: the introduction of (Lib Dem) Lord (Tim) Clement-Jones’ [Public Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision-Making Systems Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3760) ([The Register have a write-up](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/10/uk_lords_algorithms_bill/)), and a debate on [Improving the performance, independence and accountability of UK Regulators](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-09/debates/A82E408B-17EA-428D-963D-BB1DF2110D08/Watchdogs(IndustryAndRegulatorsCommitteeReport)) following [a select committee report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/ldindreg/56/5602.htm)… 12 September: a question on [‘False information through electronic media’](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-09-12/debates/4104B7AA-3534-4925-A197-D79DCD2B1850/ElectronicMediaFalseInformation) from Lord Dubs (Lab)...

Coming up… in the Commons… 7 October: [debate on the Darzi review](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48915)… 16 October: [DSIT questions](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48684)… 17 October: [DCMS questions](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48686)… 24 October: [Cabinet Office questions](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48692)…

Lords Communications and Digital Committee has a new inquiry, [Scaling up - AI and creative tech](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8502/) - it’s accepting evidence until 16 October.

Something else to keep an eye on: expect to see more [all-party parliamentary groups being set up](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/registers-published-in-2024/) over the coming weeks. [APPGs](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/apg/) are informal cross-party groups of parliamentarians interested in particular topics - some of them can be quite active, with events and even reports (and if nothing else may be useful for seeing which MPs and peers are interested in certain issues).

The Houses return on Monday 7 October.
