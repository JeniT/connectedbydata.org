Hello, and welcome to our seventeenth Data Policy Digest, bringing you all the latest data and AI policy developments. 

And, [well](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-69042935). [Yes](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/may/general-election-2024/). [Quite](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1142267-boris-johnson).

[June is bustin’ out all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCCuhpp3bb0) and we’re all aboard the dizzying electoral carousel. Work plans have been torn up, holidays cancelled, and newsletter drafts repurposed as the UK hurtles more quickly than most of us expected towards a general election. 

You can expect this newsletter to be more frequent and - most importantly - shorter through the campaign. (Dear god, let it be shorter - the campaign feels long enough already.)

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@connectedbydata.org](mailto:gavin@connectedbydata.org)**. We’re on Twitter @ConnectedByData and @DataReform. You can also **[catch up on previous Digests](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-data-policy-digest)**.

### **Deeply DPDIB** {#deeply-dpdib}

The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill has fallen. 

Not the latest and nerdiest entry in the [Gerard Butler/Morgan Freeman film franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Has_Fallen), but a significant moment for us data policy folk. To put it more straightforwardly (but equally cinematically): [Ding-dong, the Bill is dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPIdRJlzERo). 

Rishi Sunak’s decision to dissolve parliament and call an election means we entered ‘wash-up’, [defined by parliament](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/wash-up/) as ‘the last few days of a Parliament before dissolution. Any unfinished business is lost at dissolution and the Government may need the co-operation of the Opposition in passing legislation that is still in progress.’ (Not to be confused with ‘wash-out’, defined by me as an historically bad piece of political comms [announcing the election](https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-jokes-hes-avoided-pneumonia-after-wet-election-launch-as-he-explains-downing-street-call-to-yorkshire-voters-at-wetherspoons-13142848) which may yet turn out to be a pathetic fallacy for the election result. You can insert your own ‘Things Can Only Get Wetter’, ‘Tory wet’ and ‘Drowning Street’ jokes.)

[Some Bills were rushed through](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd11d37rpw9o). Some, including DPDIB, were not. 

The [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/rushing-dpdi-bill-disaster-for-uk-data-protection-rights/) and [Big Brother Watch](https://x.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1793340136425467952) were among those hoping it wouldn’t pass; the [Digital Marketing Association](https://www.cityam.com/tech-industry-pushes-sunak-to-pass-key-data-protection-bill-before-the-election/) and [techUK](https://x.com/techUKCEO/status/1793681443438411808) were among those hoping it would. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/morning-tech-uk/) that ‘the government wouldn’t budge over late amendments giving officials powers to inspect bank accounts of benefit recipients’, even though the government had apparently been considering some concessions to get the Bill through even before the election was called. Mishcon de Reya’s [Jon Baines](https://www.mishcon.com/news/the-end-of-the-data-protection-and-digital-information-bill) and [UKAuthority](https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/data-protection-and-digital-information-bill-falls-in-parliament-wash-up/?s=03) were among those with reaction.

So the UK’s data regime stays as before - for now. Those DWP powers are gone, though they weren’t (as [some suggest](https://www.techuk.org/resource/data-protection-and-digital-information-bill-falls-ahead-of-the-uk-general-election.html)) the only things wrong with [a missed opportunity of a bill that weakened safeguards and swept away rights](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources). Less controversial changes have also been put on ice, including provisions on smart data, the National Underground Asset Register, digital identity services, and converting the Information Commissioner’s Office (a ‘corporation sole’ in the legal jargon) into the Information Commission - the ICO had just published ads for an [Interim Chief Executive Officer - Fixed Term Contract (up to two years)](https://www.gatenbysanderson.com/job/GSe110941/) and [some non-executive directors](https://apply-for-public-appointment.service.gov.uk/roles/8060) in expectation (follow the links and you’ll see both have disappeared). The Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner survives, when it had been expected to be [a transitional appointment](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-the-new-biometrics-and-surveillance-camera-commissioner). There might also have been something coming on researcher access to tech company data - at DSIT questions, [minister Saqib Bhatti told a questioning Miriam Cates to ‘watch this space’](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-22/debates/CDE1E1E2-9450-46B1-BE89-7BF98B4942D6/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-9A710366-4FB6-4E2E-8B7F-27FA360E0426). The [Camrose/Kidron amendment](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/stages/18402/amendments/10013043) allowing coroners to require information from tech companies regardless of the cause of a child’s death has also fallen. (An issue unlikely to go away - today The Guardian has a story, [UK mother of boy who killed himself seeks right to access his social media](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/29/uk-mother-boy-who-killed-himself-social-media-access).)

[Politico reports](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/morning-tech-uk/) that Labour could ‘revive parts of the Bill’ if it wins the election: ‘one person close to the Labour frontbench said the party is keen on some aspects of the bill, such as proposals to broaden data use for research purposes — while there have also been suggestions the party could wrap up aspects of the data reform within a wider AI bill’. 

For completeness… our [two](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/04/03/data-policy-digest) [previous](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2024/05/02/data-policy-digest) [Digests](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-data-policy-digest) summarised **Lords committee stage**, the most consequential 7 days since Craig David… pre-election announcement, dates had been given for Lords report stage: [Monday 10 June](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48342) and [Wednesday 12 June](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal48345), which is when the Lords would have had another go at debating, scrutinising and amending the Bill (including being able to vote on the latter)... [some ‘will write’ letters](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430/publications), from ministers to peers, have been added to the Bill page…  

One of the subjects covered was those **DWP powers** - to access data about bank accounts of benefit claimants (including pensions) and those associated with them - which continued to generate most controversy and coverage... [Big Brother Watch delivered a bumper petition](https://x.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1790384112445882696) to Downing Street ([Petition against DWP’s plans for bank ‘mass spying’ powers nears 200k signatures](https://www.cityam.com/petition-against-dwps-plans-for-bank-mass-spying-powers-nears-200k-signatures/), reported City AM, who also had an editorial on how [Proposed snooping powers are an incursion into our most basic rights](https://www.cityam.com/proposed-snooping-powers-are-an-incursion-into-our-most-basic-rights/))… new research from Demos - [“This system is rigged”: A social media listening exploration revealing how people are talking about poverty online](https://demos.co.uk/research/this-system-is-rigged-a-social-media-listening-exploration-revealing-how-people-are-talking-about-poverty-online/) - found concerns are cutting through to the public (see [page 40](https://demos.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/This-System-is-Rigged_JRF-V2.pdf#page=40))... [DWP anti-fraud measures will allow monitoring of bank accounts of landlords, carers and parents](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366582876/DWP-anti-fraud-measures-will-allow-monitoring-of-bank-accounts-of-landlords-carers-and-parents) (Computer Weekly)...

MPs had tabled an early day motion, [Government surveillance of bank accounts](https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/62225) ([‘Another Horizon’ – MPs table motion against DWP bank-monitoring proposals](https://www.publictechnology.net/2024/05/13/society-and-welfare/another-horizon-mps-table-motion-against-dwp-bank-monitoring-proposals/) is the Public Technology headline)... ‘This measure is expected to save the taxpayer £600 million over five years’ says an [updated fraud plan from DWP](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dwp-updates-fraud-plan)… while various outlets (eg [the Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/dwp-tries-bank-account-checks-29191387)) wrote up relevant bits of the impact assessment into a story…

This all came around **further DWP/data concern**, with Schools Week reporting a DfE/DWP link - [Revealed: Secret deal to let benefit fraud squad snoop on pupil data](https://schoolsweek.co.uk/revealed-secret-deal-to-let-benefit-fraud-squad-snoop-on-pupil-data/) - thanks to [work from Defend Digital Me](https://defenddigitalme.org/2024/05/10/comment-secret-deal-lets-benefit-fraud-squad-snoop-on-pupil-data/)…

Additionally… openDemocracy looked at the state of **Subject Access Requests** even before the Bill’s planned changes to them, [Revealed: ‘Wild West’ for personal data undermines UK human rights](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/freedom-of-information/personal-data-sar-request-undermines-basic-legal-human-rights/)… anyone interested in the **democratic engagement** clauses might like new academic research, [Citizens’ Acceptance of Data-Driven Political Campaigning: A 25-Country Cross-National Vignette Study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08944393241249708) (Social Science Computer Review), this piece on how [Campaign microtargeting and AI can jeopardize democracy](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/campaign-microtargeting-and-ai-can-jeopardize-democracy/) (LSE) and be interested in the [Tories self-refer[ring] to ICO over data breach](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4208357/tories-self-refer-ico-breach) (Computing)... on **international transfers**, [It’s time to ban TikTok for the sake of our democracy and security](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/its-time-ban-tiktok-sake-democracy-security), wrote Lord Alton, in support of Lord Bethell’s amendment, for PoliticsHome… on **algorithmic transparency**, we were told to expect a set of releases by central government departments [by the end of July](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-05-07/24976)… the Law Society Gazette reports on [some controversy around home buying](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/cilex-enters-homebuying-information-pack-row/5119544.article) - one of the **Smart Data** sectors likely to be supported by the Bill… 

And in **other news**, Computer Weekly asks [What does the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill mean for UK industry?](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/What-does-the-Data-Protection-and-Digital-Information-Bill-mean-for-UK-industry)... the [Welsh Government has asked for discussions](https://www.gov.wales/written-statement-inter-ministerial-standing-committee-12-march-2024) to ‘facilitate progress’ on the Bill… [The UK's quest to boost digital surveillance in 2024 isn't over](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/the-uks-quest-to-boost-digital-surveillance-in-2024-isnt-over), is TechRadar’s take… I’m nearly a year late to this, but Andrew Harvey, of the National Health and Care Strategic Information Governance Network, wrote about the [Likely Implications of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill on the Health and Care Sector](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/likely-implications-data-protection-digital-bill-care-andrew/?trackingId=djVB7JjE4vgYvKMkvHs8Gw%3D%3D)… and while we’re on data protection, keep an eye on Schrems III: [Caped hero takes on giant - again](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/commentary-and-opinion/caped-hero-takes-on-giant-again/5119641.article) (Law Society Gazette).

DPDIB: gone, but not forgotten. Congratulations to everyone who contributed to scrutinising and ultimately stopping the proposed damage to our data protection regime. We, and the [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), will continue to work on how that regime should be improved, whoever wins the election.


### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024** This one [*did* make it through](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453) and has received [Royal Assent](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-markets-competition-and-consumers-act-receives-royal-assent) to become law.

And in parliament… there was a Westminster Hall debate in parliament on [Smartphones and Social Media: Children](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-14/debates/9EEEE3FC-7B2A-45E4-87E8-9449B603B1D9/SmartphonesAndSocialMediaChildren) (Miriam Cates MP, 14 May)... and [MPs urge under-16s UK smartphone ban and statutory ban in schools](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/25/mps-urge-under-16s-smartphone-ban-statutory-ban-schools), writes the Guardian about a pre-dissolution report from the Education Select Committee.

**Other** The **Automated Vehicles Bill** is now the [Automated Vehicles Act](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3506/stages), as of Monday 20 May - the Commons Library has [a briefing](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10011/) while there’s been a lot of attention on some of the private sector players, eg [Wayve’s charm offensive: How slick lobbying helped bag Europe’s biggest AI deal](https://www.politico.eu/article/wayve-hanbury-lobbying-ai-deal-automated-vehicles-bill-self-drive-laws-self-driving-vehicles/) (Politico), and V[ote of confidence in UK economy as British AI company Wayve secures over $1 billion to develop AI for self-driving vehicles](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vote-of-confidence-in-uk-economy-as-british-ai-company-wayve-secures-over-1-billion-to-develop-ai-for-self-driving-vehicles) (DSIT)... there were several relevant (and unsuccessful) amendments to the **Criminal Justice Bill**, including Sarah Owen (Lab) wanting to [make AI election misinformation illegal](https://x.com/SarahOwen_/status/1790741847930798294), and Caroline Nokes (Con) on [non-consensual intimate images](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carolinenokes_yesterdays-debate-on-the-criminal-justice-activity-7196966810888347648-vlur/)… and the **Artificial Intelligence (Regulation) Bill**, [Lord Holmes’ private members’ bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3519), has also fallen with the prorogation of parliament.

### **Never mind the ballots** {#never-mind-the-ballots}

**News Tory** ‘China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead in technology’ was the only mention of tech or data in [the PM’s speech announcing the election](https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunaks-full-speech-announcing-general-election-on-4-july-13141431). AI got more of an outing at his [speech on security](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-security-13-may-2024) the previous week, which acknowledged heightened fears about AI. ‘But the paradox of our age is that for all the profound dangers we face, right now, we also hold in our hands an opportunity for human progress that could surpass the industrial revolution in speed and breadth. Technologies like AI will do for the 21st century what the steam engine and electricity did for the 19th.’ He also spoke to the I about [Revolutionary AI trial offers breast cancer hope for millions on NHS, Sunak reveals](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/ai-trial-breast-cancer-millions-nhs-sunak-reveals-3063900) around the Seoul AI Summit, which the UK co-hosted.

The main Tory/data story so far is an unexpected one: [Rishi ran Peloton 5k in California after calling election](https://order-order.com/2024/05/28/revealed-rishi-ran-peloton-5k-in-california-after-calling-election/) (Guido Fawkes). Labour also had some fun with the confluence of rumours about Sunak’s next steps post-election and Tory attacks on ‘mickey mouse degrees’ with [an unfortunate photo](https://x.com/labourpress/status/1796264538595279006).

**Labour movement** [Keir Starmer’s speech upon the election being called](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmer-delivering-a-speech-on-the-announcement-of-the-uk-general-election/) railed against the current way of doing politics ‘that is at best doing something to people, not with them. But at its worst, as we saw in horrifying detail in Westminster last week, those twin injustices – the Horizon and Infected Blood scandals, is something much, much darker even than that.’

AI and data may not end up as a major campaign issue in its own right - Starmer’s [first major speech](https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmer-speech-country-first-party-second/) didn’t mention it - but it may be integral to policy and delivery in other areas and could be a dividing line between the parties. We saw a bit of that - on AI regulation - in the debate following [a ministerial statement on the AI Seoul Summit](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-23/debates/6DCE4EE5-A806-4B94-8DB8-731906631900/AISeoulSummit). Labour underlined that it would use legislation to force AI companies on safety testing, in contrast to the Conservatives’ voluntary approach, and criticised the government for not settling the copyright and IP questions arising from AI. 

The latest version of Labour’s New Deal for Working People - [‘Labour’s Plan to Make Work Pay’](https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/a-new-deal-for-working-people/) - has a few things on tech, including a Labour government working with workers, unions, employers and experts ‘to examine what AI and new technologies mean for work, jobs and skills, and how to promote best practice in safeguarding against the invasion of privacy through surveillance technology, spyware and discriminatory algorithmic decision making’ - ‘at a minimum [ensuring] proposals to introduce surveillance technologies would be subject to consultation and negotiation’. They would also ‘update regulations to outlaw the use of predictive technologies for blacklisting and safeguard against singling out workers for mistreatment or the sack without any evidence of human interaction’ and introduce a right to switch off.

**A farewell to harms** The first tech issue to properly break through into the campaign so far would seem to be online safety. Today, the Molly Rose Foundation has published a five point plan, which includes a new Online Safety Act, greater tech company transparency and a one-off windfall tax. [‘The tech giants must be more open’](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/the-guardian-view-on-social-media-harms-the-tech-giants-must-be-more-open) is the Guardian’s editorial take. Yesterday, shadow DSIT secretary [Peter Kyle confirmed](https://x.com/peterkyle/status/1797206944895127899) Labour would introduce legislation on coroner access to children’s data after a child’s death. Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative Victoria Atkins were quizzed about access to children’s data on the [BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg](https://x.com/mollyroseorg/status/1797188327143030993) (though the question seemed to be about parental access, rather than coroner access). [‘Labour promises to give bereaved families access to children’s social media “as fast as possible”’](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-yvette-cooper-childen-social-media-b2555243.html) is the Independent’s take on that discussion (they’ve also [clipped the relevant questions](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/election-yvette-cooper-victoria-atkins-b2555234.html)).

**Everything else** Rishi Sunak [isn’t the only party leader to have gotten soaked](https://x.com/BBCPolitics/status/1795403377267913066) so far - Lib Dem leader [Ed Davey](https://x.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1795417238813487314) did too. (You can insert your own ‘Swimming Here’, ‘Lib Dems buoyant’ or ‘floating voter’ jokes.) [Tax online giants to help kids' mental health, say Lib Dems](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggq5jpx5do) is their main digital/data line so far.

We’ll be keeping an eye out for manifestos from civil society and others during the campaign - get in touch if you’ve spotted or are publishing something. As well as the civil society [Progressive Vision](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/progressive-vision) ([pamphlet version](https://connectedbydata.org/assets/resources/Progressive-Vision-Pamphlet.pdf)) and the [recently-launched](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/odi-manifesto-launch-event-a-summary/) [Open Data Institute manifesto](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/launching-the-odi-policy-manifesto/), there’s also… OpenUK’s [Open Manifesto 2024](https://openuk.uk/openmanifesto/)… [Seven exponential policies for a new government](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/seven-exponential-policies-for-a) (Azeem Azhar, Exponential View)... techUK’s [general election hub](https://www.techuk.org/shaping-policy/techuk-s-election-hub.html)… [Full Fact’s election live blog](https://fullfact.org/live/)…  [Fix the digital divide – for good](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/fix-the-digital-divide) from Good Things Foundation… free refurbished digital devices and training for the digitally excluded, and automatic social tariffs through data matching can be found in [the Fabian manifesto](https://fabians.org.uk/the-fabian-manifesto/)… [Charity sector bodies call on next government to establish ‘civil society charter’](https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/charity-sector-bodies-call-on-next-government-to-establish-civil-society-charter.html) (Civil Society)... and [The British Academy calls for next government to strengthen humanities and social sciences to tackle the UK's biggest challenges](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/news/the-british-academy-calls-for-next-government-to-strengthen-humanities-and-social-sciences-to-tackle-the-uks-biggest-challenges/).

### **AI got ‘rithm** {#ai-got-rithm}

Let’s try to keep this short. (And fail, miserably.)

**Summit going on** The UK co-hosted [the AI Seoul Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/ai-seoul-summit-2024) with South Korea, the summit title newly shorn of ‘safety’. UK Rishi Sunak co-authored a piece with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol (his Seoul-mate? So he wasn’t the Seoul author? geddit?!?!), [Only global AI standards can stop a race to the bottom](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/ai-regulation-not-far-enough-firms-must-do-more-3063310) (the I). Michelle Donelan took [questions on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191344603336220672/). 

This is what DSIT published about it… [AI Seoul Summit programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-seoul-summit-programme)… [New commitment to deepen work on severe AI risks concludes AI Seoul Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-commitmentto-deepen-work-on-severe-ai-risks-concludes-ai-seoul-summit)… [Seoul Ministerial Statement for advancing AI safety, innovation and inclusivity: AI Seoul Summit 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/seoul-ministerial-statement-for-advancing-ai-safety-innovation-and-inclusivity-ai-seoul-summit-2024)… [Secretary of State Michelle Donelan opens the AI Seoul Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/secretary-of-state-michelle-donelan-opens-the-ai-seoul-summit)… [Frontier AI Safety Commitments, AI Seoul Summit 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024)… [Seoul Declaration for safe, innovative and inclusive AI: AI Seoul Summit 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/seoul-declaration-for-safe-innovative-and-inclusive-ai-ai-seoul-summit-2024)… it followed publication of the first [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai) ([press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/safety-of-advanced-ai-under-the-spotlight-in-first-ever-independent-international-scientific-report) - [Report highlights disagreement among experts on AI safety](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366585753/Report-highlights-disagreement-among-experts-on-AI-safety) was Computer Weekly’s take)... and was accompanied by various other international announcements from the UK, including [Historic first as companies spanning North America, Asia, Europe and Middle East agree safety commitments on development of AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/historic-first-as-companies-spanning-north-america-asia-europe-and-middle-east-agree-safety-commitments-on-development-of-ai)…

You may remember when the UK hosted the first AI (Safety) Summit, we in UK civil society were Not Happy at our voices not being heard. Sadly [our Korean counterparts had similar complaints](https://culturalaction.org/48/?q=YToxOntzOjEyOiJrZXl3b3JkX3R5cGUiO3M6MzoiYWxsIjt9&bmode=view&idx=22842154&t=board). We also put out a statement - with the TUC and ORG, co-organisers of [our open letter](https://ai-summit-open-letter.info/) from the autumn:

> The Summit in Seoul looks to be a departure from the X-risk hype that engulfed the UK’s summit in 2023. There is a welcome focus on the social, economic and environmental implications of AI that civil society worldwide has been demanding. However, we’re yet again seeing civil society’s voice sidelined in favour of corporations and governments. This lesson from the U.K. Summit does not appear to have been learnt. Let’s hope France in 2025 does better!

The Guardian had a couple of summary pieces - [Trying to tame AI: Seoul summit flags hurdles to regulation](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/27/trying-to-tame-ai-seoul-summit-flags-hurdles-to-regulation), and [What we learned from the global AI summit in South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/28/techscape-ai-global-summit) - and spoke to Max Tegmark, [Big tech has distracted world from existential risk of AI, says top scientist](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/25/big-tech-existential-risk-ai-scientist-max-tegmark-regulations).

There were also AI Safety Institute developments around the Summit… [Government's trailblazing Institute for AI Safety to open doors in San Francisco](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/governments-trailblazing-institute-for-ai-safety-to-open-doors-in-san-francisco), a [UK-Canada science of AI safety partnership](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-canada-science-of-ai-safety-partnership), [Global leaders agree to launch first international network of AI Safety Institutes to boost cooperation of AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/global-leaders-agree-to-launch-first-international-network-of-ai-safety-institutes-to-boost-understanding-of-ai), [AI Safety Institute releases new AI safety evaluations platform](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-safety-institute-releases-new-ai-safety-evaluations-platform) (all DSIT - see also new [research funding](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-secretary-unveils-85-million-research-funding-set-to-break-new-grounds-in-ai-safety-testing) and [grants](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/systemic-ai-safety-fast-grants))...

### **Parly-vous data?** {#parly-vous-data}

Parliament was [prorogued](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/prorogation/) on 24 May and then [dissolved on 30 May](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2024/may/general-election-2024/) (by [royal proclamation](https://x.com/PARLYapp/status/1796152323665776645) - there had been [some disagreement as to exactly when](https://x.com/woodstockjag/status/1795942289312805166)). All business - bills, tabled questions etc - fell with prorogation, but select committees had some extra time to rush their reports out before dissolution. Those included the Education Select Committee, [Screen time: impacts on education and wellbeing](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7912/screen-time-impacts-on-education-and-wellbeing/publications/), summarised by the Guardian as [MPs urge under-16s UK smartphone ban and statutory ban in schools](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/25/mps-urge-under-16s-smartphone-ban-statutory-ban-schools) (25 May) and the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee on the [Governance of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmsctech/38/report.html) (28 May). The SIT committee has helpfully published [a summary of its activity during the parliament](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmsctech/826/report.html), and suggests some things its successors might want to look at.

Even before the election announcement, there was a lot going on.

Let’s start with the Commons… **2 May** A PACAC [report on lobbying](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6878/lobbying-and-influence-postlegislative-scrutiny-of-the-lobbying-act-2014-and-related-matters/publications/) noted the importance of better data, and how to handle [messages on WhatsApp](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/pacac-whatsapp-should-be-banned-on-government-devices-unless-appropriate-transparency-regime-is-introduced)… **7 May** Westminster Hall [debate on cyber-security](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-07/debates/AFD5E683-720D-44F5-84D5-019E0B51AD87/Cyber-Security) (Sir Mark Hendrick, Lab)... **8 May** [Women and Equalities Committee heard from campaigner and reality TV star Georgia Harrison plus OnlyFans CEO on tackling revenge porn](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/20790)… there was a ministerial statement on [a Passport e-Gates Network Outage](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-08/debates/4453EA34-02A8-4904-B9B4-AFB7B767ACB6/PassportE-GatesNetworkOutage)… **9 May** MPs chose [Jackie Doyle-Price as the new chair of PACAC](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/news/article/jackie-doyle-price-pacac-new-chair) (not that she had much time to enjoy it)… **14 May** Westminster Hall debate on [Smartphones and Social Media: Children](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-14/debates/9EEEE3FC-7B2A-45E4-87E8-9449B603B1D9/SmartphonesAndSocialMediaChildren) (Miriam Cates, Con)... **15 May** [Ten Minute Rule](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/ten-minute-rule-bill/) motion on [Child Sexual Abuse Material (Digital Devices)](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-15/debates/C79F2223-A099-46F2-AF00-2569F4CF18D8/ChildSexualAbuseMaterial(DigitalDevices))... **21 May** The Women and Equalities committee noted that [Government abandons pay transparency pilot](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/328/women-and-equalities-committee/news/201631/government-abandons-pay-transparency-pilot/)… **22 May** [DSIT question time](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-22/debates/CDE1E1E2-9450-46B1-BE89-7BF98B4942D6/OralAnswersToQuestions)… Secretary of State Lucy Frazer was quizzed on [AI and the creative industries](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21498) as part of a ‘work of DCMS’ session (Q5 onwards gets straight to some of the big questions) - a few days before she spoke to the FT, [UK working on rules for training of AI models with creative work](https://www.ft.com/content/17f4c7ee-b1bc-4bde-8e92-bebb555479a2)… **23 May** ministerial statement on [the Seoul AI Summit](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-23/debates/6DCE4EE5-A806-4B94-8DB8-731906631900/AISeoulSummit)… **24 May** PACAC published their report on [Transforming the UK’s Evidence Base](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7808/transforming-the-uks-evidence-base/publications/) (to which we contributed [written](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/123933/html/) and [oral](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/19851/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) evidence)... **25 May** a [PAC report on whistleblowing](https://x.com/owenboswarva/status/1795095319933338001) included a bit on the need for better (or indeed, any) data…

As for the Lords… **2 May** The [government responded](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7827/large-language-models/publications/) to the LLM report from the Digital and Communications Committee, which the committee was [not delighted with](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4205153/house-lords-committee-slams-government-inaction-llm-copyright-misuse), eliciting [another response from DSIT](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7827/large-language-models/publications/)… **7 May**  the European Affairs Committee took evidence on [UK-EU data adequacy](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21349)… **8 May** a question on [deepfakes and the general election](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2024-05-08/debates/92AB0B5C-33AB-4278-B9A1-37A90FD93561/DeepfakesGeneralElection) (Maggie Jones, Lab)... and a statement on a [defence data breach](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-05-08/debates/27C3FAE1-7087-4D8C-A2D4-C5F31F23FD59/DefencePersonnelDataBreach)… **9 May** Lord Holmes (Con) had a question on [AI and intellectual property rights](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-05-09/debates/1C01AE4E-3D93-4AF0-8BFF-58754781F54E/AIIntellectualPropertyRights), while **10 May** brought the [third reading of his AI regulation bill](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-05-10/debates/197D481F-23DF-4768-943B-7E25BE1AA6B4/ArtificialIntelligence(Regulation)Bill(HL))… **14 May** evidence from Ofcom as part of the future of news inquiry (Communications and Digital Committee - there was also a session on [SLAPPs](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/business-management/slapps-and-reputational-risks) on [7 May](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21489))... evidence session on [Data and Digital Trade](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21540)… **15 May** Question from Lord Davies (Lab) on _[Better, broader, safer: using health data for research and analysis](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2024-05-15/debates/EF9E8951-4C16-4136-A5A2-BB92F8B6A3C9/HealthDataResearchAndAnalysis)_ (the Goldacre Review)... **21 May** another evidence session on [UK-EU data adequacy](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/21538)… **22 May** The Joint Committee on National Security Strategy called on the [Prime Minister to defend the UK’s democracy as snap election is called](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/111/national-security-strategy-joint-committee/news/201706/jcnss-calls-on-prime-minister-to-defend-the-uks-democracy-as-snap-election-is-called/)…

Separately, parliament published its [Information and Digital Strategy for 2024-27](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/nformation-and-digital-strategy-for-parliament-202427/).

We obviously don’t yet know what’s coming up or when, given the election - except that parliament will return on **9 July**. With the [number of MPs departing](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/mps-standing-down-next-election) and a possible change of government, parliament - and all its select committees, whose constitution is determined by the election result - could look quite different.
