title: We need to change how data is regulated
more: changing public policy
points:
  -
    heading: Current **data protection regulations** such as GDPR are oriented around individual privacy.
  -
    heading: We need the law to recognise that **non-personal data** can be harmful too, and that harms can fall on **groups**, wider **society** and our **environment**, not just on individuals.
  -
    heading: We need regulators to **enable and encourage** organisations to try new, collective ways of making decisions about data, while continuing to protect us and our rights.
  -
    heading: We need regulation to encourage organisations to consider **public benefit**, **group harms** and **environmental impacts**, alongside their **own interests** and **personal privacy** when deciding what to do with data.
  -
    heading: We need to **strengthen requirements** when decisions are made about data that need to **balance** different rights and interests. These must be made by groups that **include those affected** and there must be **transparency** about the results.
