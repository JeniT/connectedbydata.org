    heading: We need to stop talking about data as if it is something we can **own**.
  -
    heading: We need to highlight how and why **individual consent** and **privacy controls** fail us.
  -
    heading: "We need to show how we are **connected by data**: how data about other people affects our lives, just as data about us affects theirs."
  -
    heading: We need to find the **metaphors** that resonate with people, drawing on the other aspects of our lives where our rights are balanced against those of others.
