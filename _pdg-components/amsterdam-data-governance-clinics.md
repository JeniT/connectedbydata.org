Two pilot data governance clinics were run with projects in Amsterdam  using data analytics to improve city services, and grappling with questions of data sourcing.

The clinics were run over a series of workshops, initially face-to-face, and then online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The clinics are described in the researchers write-up as "elite participatory action research", working with leaders of data projects to dig into issues of public interest, user need and practical governance through an independently facilitated dialogue.
