To prepare for the public dialogue on location data ethics, the Ada Lovelace Institute and Traverse carried out a rapid review, drawing on literature, desk research and a stakeholder workshop.

This process led to a topic review, covering an introduction to location data, existing research on public attitudes towards data, different definitions of location data, properties of location data, potential discussion questions for the dialogue, and a range of potential case studies. 

An Easy Read version of the topic review was created. 

An Oversight group and the Geospatial Commission were consulted during the drafting.
