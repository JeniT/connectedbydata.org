  These surveys include the First Nations Regional Health Survey (FNRHS), the First
  Nations Regional Early Childhood, Education, and Employment Survey (FNREEES), and
  the First Nations Labour and Employment Development (FNLED) survey. Over the past
  two decades, data from these surveys has played a key role in the closing the data
  gap for First Nations communities and informed the development of such community
  health programs.'
