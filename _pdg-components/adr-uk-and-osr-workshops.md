background_information_described: Yes. The workshops included two short ‘explainer’
  presentations from representatives from ADR UK and OSR to contextualise the use
  of data for both research and statistics. Prior to the workshops, participants were
  communicated with by phone call, text and email, as per their preference, to manage
  expectations and address any potential concerns.

description: 'Structure


  In-person workshops involved a maximum of 10 participants who were split into groups
  of four to five participants, each group had a facilitator and separate note-taker.
  Participants in the online workshop were split into five breakout rooms of four
  to five participants, also with a facilitator and separate note-taker per breakout
  room. The online breakout rooms were assembled to include at least one person from
  each of the four nations to ensure representation from across the UK. All audio
  was recorded and facilitators followed a script to ensure topics were covered consistently. 


  Dynamic


  Each workshop began with facilitators covering workshop aims and agenda with space
  for questions and further explanations. By engaging with hypothetical case studies
  of different uses of data for research and statistics, and a range of real-life
  perspectives on data for research and statistics, participants spent the entirety
  of the workshop undertaking interactive activities and group reflections around:

  1. What does ‘public’ mean? What does ‘good’ mean? What do they mean together? 

  2. Do a certain number of people need to benefit for something to be considered
  in the ‘public good’?  

  3. ‘Public good’ is something referred to by other phrases, such as ‘public benefit’
  or ‘public interest’? Do either of these phrases have different connotations to
  you than ‘public good’?

  4. How do you think that data about you might be used for public good?  

  5. Can anyone provide a reason why they would not want their data to be used?

  6. Does data use count as ’public good’ if some people benefit while others’ situation
  remains unchanged?

  7. Does it matter if the organisation using data for public good also makes money
  as a by-product of that use?

  8. If a use of data is considered to be strongly in the public good, would you be
  comfortable for sensitive data to be used for that purpose?

  9. If a use of data is considered to be strongly in the public good, would you be
  comfortable for sensitive data to be used for that purpose?

  10. Does this view seem surprising to you? Why do you think this person feels this? 

  11. Is this view part of your personal definition of what public good Is?

  12. How would you tell that something is an acceptable use of data or statistics? 

  13. In your dream society, what could data and statistics be achieving for people?


  Upon reflection, it was decided that the representatives from representatives from
  ADR UK and OSR would leave the room after delivering their explainer presentations
  for subsequent workshops. This was to allay any potential concerns of participants
  possibly feeling uncomfortable articulating distrust or criticism towards either
  ADR UK or OSR.
