Participants were recruited in India, South Africa and the UK to download and use the MindKind app for recording information about their mental health and behaviours. 

They were randomly assigned to one of four 'governance' conditions, the first of which (Group A) asked about participant detailed preference questions on how data should be governed, and the remaining three (Groups B, C, D) addressed the acceptability of different data governance models.

- "Research norm (Group B): This option presents current researcher community norms for data use, whereby researchers will be able to download a copy of the data from the databank following strict data security rules. Data may be used, unrestricted, by both commercial and non-commercial researchers.
- Youth informed democracy with download (Group C): Study participants will vote as described in the Democracy Choice above. Under this model, researchers are allowed to download a copy of the data.
- Youth informed democracy without download (Group D): Study participants will vote as described in the Democracy Choice above. Under this data governance model, data may only be accessed via a restricted server."[1]

Researchers also gave some participants a choice over the order in which the app would ask data collection questions, whereas an alternative group of participants were not given these choices.

Researchers tracked levels of engagement with the app, and how long participants continued to engage with the study, based on the choice of data governance model.
