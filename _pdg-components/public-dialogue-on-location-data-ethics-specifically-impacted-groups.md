title: 'Public Dialogue on Location Data Ethics: Specifically Impacted Groups'
---

In addition to the public dialogues, three focus groups, each one targeted at a specific group particularly impacted by location data, took place.

While five specifically impacted groups were identified, consultation with organisations familiar with these groups was used to identify whether they should be included in the main dialogues, or whether their needs were better served by a dedicated focus group session.
