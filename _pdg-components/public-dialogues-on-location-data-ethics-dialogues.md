  and asked to take part in a survey and preparation activity in advance of the sessions.
  \n\nEarly sessions included expert presentations in plenary and topical break-out
  groups. \n\nIn later sessions, after participants had carried out their own peer-research,
  participants shared findings back in small-group breakouts."

  6 weeks, through June and July 2021, with a fourth workshop for a smaller number

  than 7 people for the discursive and deliberative elements of the dialogue.\"\n\nParticipants
  were asked to carry out preparatory reading, and to complete tasks and surveys between
