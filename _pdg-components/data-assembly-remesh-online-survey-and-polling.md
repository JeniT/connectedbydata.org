background_information_described: Participants were presented with three 'Data re-use
  exhibits' describing how data might be re-used.

decision_methods_tag:
- Opinion Survey (i.e. taken before and/or after participants convened)
description: "The data assembly held three 'mini-public' events with different participant
  groups. The residents mini-public made use of an online platform (Remesh) with a
  55-strong sample of New York City residents selected using a sampling methodology
  provided by the paltform.\n\nParticipants were presented with poling questions,
  freeform text prompts, and had the ability to engage with and indicate their support
  for contributions from other participants. \n\nOf particular note, the project report
  notes that:\n\n> \"The majority of participants were not concerned about place-based
  data privacy and security issues. Participants were comfortable with the collection
  and analysis of aggregated location data drawn from potentially sensitive areas,
  such as protests or places of worship. This reaction differs significantly from
  insights drawn in both the dataholder and policymaker mini-public as well as the
  rights and advocacy group minipublic. This likely speaks to the composition of the
  mini-public, which was diverse across various criteria outlined above, but likely
  did not include a large number of individuals with specific sensitivities related
  to, for example, political activism or religious sensitivities.\""
