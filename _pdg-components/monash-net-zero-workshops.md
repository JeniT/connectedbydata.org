> "We held a series of two participatory engagement workshops to create inclusive learning environments for precinct citizens to discuss opportunities for mutual value creation and concerns about data collection, use and ownership, and start to understand diverse needs." 

The first workshop introduced issues around data governance "as a process for managing value generation, control and collective good." and included Zoom/Miro based post-it note activities to look at (a) "Perceptions (what we think happens); (b) Practices (what we currently do); (c) Expectations (how things should be); and (d) Uncertainties (what we want to know)."

The second workshop used rapid prototyping methods, and 'How might we?" questions, then prioritised into four worked-up ptotype ideas for "a process, service, program, vision, tool or resource."
