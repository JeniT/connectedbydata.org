background_information_described: "Written, audio and video materials were provided
  in advance, and participants given an opportunity to ask questions of the research
  team.\t\nThese were carefully designed to be accessible to participants (see final
  report page 112), including using a video script voiced by local youth advisors
  to be more accessible to young people at each research site. \nAn interactive concept
  map was also prepared and shared with participants."

description: "The project carried out two rounds of deliberative democracy sessions
  in each country.\nThe first round involved cohorts of five to seven participants
  all from the same country, provided with background materials, and invited to discuss
  different data governance models and to explore concerns and hopes around data governance
  for a global mental health databank. \nThe second round involved cohorts of 6 -
  8 participants, drawing on participants from the previous cohort, but now combining
  participants across countries, and holding two 60-minute sessions, seeking to build
  on prior learning and explore similarities and differences between countries.\nThe
  study protocol outlines that: \n> \"Deliberative democracy is a distinct qualitative
  research approach, differing from focus groups by the purposeful provision of educational
  intervention to enrich group discussion. Further, there is an emphasis on discussion
  leading to iterative revision of opinions as participants integrate new information
  and others’ perspectives.\"\nThe protocol also reports that:\n> \"The quality of
  deliberative democracy sessions will be evaluated using criteria proposed by DeVries _et
  al._, 2010 [37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160707/#ref-37) ,
  including equal participation of all participants, respect for the opinions of others,
  willingness to adopt a social (rather than individualistic) perspective, and reasoned
  justification for one’s positions. These data will be gathered by the research team
  participant exit surveys.\""
