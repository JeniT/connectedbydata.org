description: '"A follow-up online workshop took place in July, roughly a month after
  the initial workshops, to clarify topics and themes discussed in the initial workshops
  and bring together UK-wide perspectives. Ten of the original participants were invited
  to attend the follow-up workshop.

  Representatives from ADR UK and OSR remained in the room for the duration of that
  workshop. Upon reflection, it was decided that they would leave the room after delivering
  their explainer presentations for subsequent workshops. This was to allay any potential
  concerns of participants possibly feeling uncomfortable articulating distrust or
  criticism towards either ADR UK or OSR."
