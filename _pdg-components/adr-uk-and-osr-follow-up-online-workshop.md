description: 'A follow-up online workshop took place roughly a month after the initial
  workshops. As far as possible, a participant was invited from each of the original
  workshop groups. The follow-up workshop aimed:

  1. to validate analysis of the workshops to ensure what participant feedback has
  been accurately communicated; 

  2. to answer questions about the initial themes, as advised by the Project Advisory
  Group; 

  3. for participants to explore practical applications of their views with the intention
  to develop some guidance for how the public perceives ‘public good’ use of data
  for research and statistics.
