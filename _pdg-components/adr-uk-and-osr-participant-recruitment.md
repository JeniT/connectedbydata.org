description: Rather than seeking a perfect demographic sample of the UK population
  or using a recruitment agency, the project hired up to three ‘community researchers’
  in each nation (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) and tasked them with
  producing a nation-specific recruitment strategy. Each nation had to recruit approximately
  15 people. The community researchers were tasked with considering how to break down
  local barriers to participation, to identify appropriate modes of invitations and
  to consider different methods of participation in the project.
