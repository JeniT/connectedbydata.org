description: 'The First Nations principles of ownership, control, access, and possession
  – more commonly known as OCAP® – assert that First Nations have control over data
  collection processes, and that they own and control how this information can be
  used. OCAP® was established in 1998 during a meeting of the National Steering Committee
  (NSC) of the First Nations and Inuit Regional Longitudinal Health Survey, a precursor
  to the First Nations Regional Health Survey (FNRHS, or RHS).

  These principles have provided an OCAP® model for partnering with government and
  non-government entities for data processing.

  To give practical expression to these principles and values, the FNIGC also developed
  a set of governance and structural supports to ensure that data sovereignty was
  achieved and protected: a code of research ethics; privacy impact assessments; and
  a cultural framework.'
