title: People will have a more meaningful say over data
points:
  -
    heading: With **better protections** in place, you won't need to worry about data being collected about you, how it is used, or how you are affected by data other people have shared.
  -
    heading: You will be able to **trust** decisions about data because they will be made by **people like you**.
  -
    heading: You won't need to feel guilty for not reading the **terms & conditions** or changing your **privacy controls**, or quitting the service. The defaults will be safe for you, your family and friends, and community. Someone will be watching your back.
  -
    heading: And if you want to be more active, you will be able to **find out** how organisations use data, and **make your voice heard**, whether that's by completing **surveys**, volunteering for **citizen juries**, or becoming a **representative** for your community.
