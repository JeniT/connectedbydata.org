Effective data governance is **collective**, **democratic**, **participatory**, **deliberative** and **powerful**. 

It is also achievable. Organisations of all shapes and sizes have found ways to engage with the concerns of communities affected by data collection, sharing and use. 

Our **observatory** of participatory data governance practice collects together examples of **projects** and **methods** for giving individuals and communities a voice in data governance decision making.

**You can:**

## Browse projects

Right across the world, organisations are exploring ways to involve communities in the governance of data: from setting overarching principles, to shaping everyday decisions.

We have been identifying and analysing a wide range of projects, exploring the overall goals of each project, and looking at the particular components and methods they use. 

The table below shows a selection of the cases we have identified and documented. Navigate to the components of the case to explore information about the number of people involved and how background information was given to equip communities to have meaningful discussions about data.

Our dataset is a work in progress, and is [based loosely on the Participedia data structure](https://participedia.net/).

It is currently hosted on AirTable, and for each of the public tables you can download a CSV version by opening the table, clicking ‘...’ at the end of the menu above the table, and selecting ‘Download CSV’
