Would you like to be a **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** Fellow?

Our Fellows work in and around collective and participatory data governance. Fellowship work can take many shapes and forms. We want to support people working on:

* **community activism**, such as working within a union, school, or local community to increase awareness of how data is being used, and demand change
* **storytelling and journalism**, such as telling the story about a particular impact of data collection or use; or developing assets such as graphics or videos that explain collective data governance
* **practitioner work**, such as supporting a deliberative process in an organisation or designing data governance processes
* **public policy development**, such as getting involved with advocacy around new data laws and policies, or creating recommendations for data regulation
* **research projects**, such as researching participatory practices across a range of organisations, or the collective impacts of a particular data practice such as personalised pricing

We expect Fellows to work with us for six to nine months. While we are seeking funding for this programme, we only offer non-financial support to Fellows, namely:

* regular interactions with, and learning from, other Fellows through a regular fortnightly catch-up
* monthly 1:1s with a member of the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** team
* expert review of work related to your Fellowship by the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** team, on request
* brokered connections with the wider **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** network
* increased amplification and visibility of your work
* potential for subcontracted work and joint bids

We are just starting up this programme and are running it in a lightweight, exploratory mode. There is no formal selection process as yet. If you are interested in becoming a **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** Fellow, please send your CV and a one-page description of your work to [jeni@connectedbydata.org](mailto:jeni@connectedbydata.org). The description should cover:

* background and context for your work
* the specific problem or research question you are tackling
* how you are tackling it
* what you expect the outputs and outcomes of your work to look like
* how long you want your fellowship to run for and how being a **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** Fellow will help you be successful

Applications are currently selected by the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** team on an ongoing basis, based on:

* **alignment** with the **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** vision and mission
* **impact** of the proposed work
* **commitment** of the fellow to the work
* **feasibility** of the proposed work plan
* **diversity** of the fellowship, in demographics, geographies, experience and interests
