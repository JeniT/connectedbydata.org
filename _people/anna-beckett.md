She is driven by a passion for giving the public a voice in decisions that affect them. She works collaboratively to ensure that peopleâ€™s voices are heard, because she believes successful engagement is the key to high quality policy development that works for everyone. She has a particular interest in how people feel about their data being used for different purposes and the impact this has as decision-making becomes increasingly data driven.

Anna is currently facilitating our Public Voice on AI public advisory panel, bringing together people from different previous deliberations on AI to shape this important programme of work.
