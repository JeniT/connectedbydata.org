Alanâ€™s career as a researcher, a policy analyst, a civil servant and a campaigner has focused on supporting efforts to understand and address governance challenges which contribute to social problems, including in countries in the global south.

Alan moved on from his most recent role with [Global Integrity](https://www.globalintegrity.org/) at the end of 2022. He is now taking some time to further explore and engage in the landscape of theory, policy and practice around embracing complexity, nurturing relationships and catalyzing collaborative learning, for social change, both internationally and closer to home.

Alan lives in Brighton, England, two minutes from the sea and twenty minutes from the South Downs national park.
