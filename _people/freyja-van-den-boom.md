They obtained their PhD with a dissertation titled “Driven by Digital Innovations: Regulating In-vehicle Data for Telematics Insurance in Europe,”. They received an M.Sc. in Sociology of Law and an M.A. and B.A in European and International Law from Tilburg University, Netherlands. Their research includes projects on inclusive AI futures, anticipatory AI and Data governance, open science, and data sovereignty. They have collaborated, presented, published and performed both their academic and artistic works and speculative designs

Freyja is currently designing [speculative design artefacts and provotypes](www.unmannedfutures.com) to provoke inclusive discussions and gain deeper insights on what AI futures people want; and whether, when and how to regulate AI to avoid power consolidation in the AI ecosystem and data value chain and environmental harms that come from generating too many fluffy cat gifs.
