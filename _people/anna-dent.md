Anna is an independent researcher and policy consultant. Her work focuses on the interactions between technology and society, primarily in the domains of work and the welfare state. She is particularly interested in the digital welfare state: what is being digitised and automated and how; the experiences of people interacting with digital public services; and the underlying policy drivers. She is currently exploring the potential at the intersection of relational practice and technology: how can technology support public services based on relational principles, centring human relationships rather than institutional priorities and digital surveillance? She [published an essay](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/publications/digital-social-security-towards-disciplinary-or-relational-futures/) in 2024 looking at this topic within the context of possible futures for digital social security.

She holds an MSc in Public Policy from the University of Bristol, achieved as a mature student. She works with the public and third sectors as well as with academia, and is an associate at Careful Trouble, 50 Degrees and Rocket Science. Her writing and research has appeared in a range of publications including The Guardian, Computer Weekly, British Academy, Big Issue and Huck Magazine.
