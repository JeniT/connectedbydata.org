Before joining **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**, Adam worked for a not-for-profit supporting public services to take a more system-wide approach to complex social issues, from health inequalities to public participation in city government. 

Bringing campaigning and communications experience, Adam is particularly interested in the nexus of media, policy and community action to make progressive ideas on big issues a reality. 

Adam is currently studying at the [Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/ucl-institute-innovation-and-public-purpose), learning more on how public policy - from social care to the climate crisis â€“ can be mobilised for these ends.
