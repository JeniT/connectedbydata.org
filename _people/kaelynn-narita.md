Kaelynn Narita is an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection between borders and technology.

<!--more-->

Her current research explores how digital tools are influencing UK migration governance. Her doctoral thesis unearths the so-called _Digital_ Hostile Environment and the technological implication of the UK's migration governance to disperse border control to public institutions and citizens. Her investigation of the tools utilises a Data Feminist methodology to challenge the process, practices and standards that transform border power. She is interested in working on rethinking the procurement process of digital technology by state actors and using community-based principles to guide data governance.

She is interested in developing new techniques to transform academic research into modes of resistance and public knowledge.
