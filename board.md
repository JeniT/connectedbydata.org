Our Governance Board provides advice, checks and balances on the structure and operation of the organisation. The Governance Board:

* Fulfils the [duties and responsibilities of Company Directors](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/being-a-company-director)
* Advises on and approves organisational structure, including the structure and composition of the Governance and Advisory Boards and any other Boards and Committees it deems necessary
* Advises on and approves organisational policies and commitments, including grant and commercial agreements
* Advises on and approves annual roadmaps, plans and budgets, and any changes to these
* Provides oversight on the Executive Director, including their appointment, performance reviews, remuneration decisions, and delegated powers

The Board:

* Ensures our organisational set up reflects our values and supports our mission and strategy, so we are more successful
* Supports the development of the Executive Director, so they are more effective as a leader, manager and external voice 
* Provides assurance for prospective funders about the good governance and sustainability of the organisation

The Governance Board is complementary to the Advisory Board, which provides strategic advice. Unlike members of the Advisory Board, members of the Governance Board are Directors of the organisation and have official decision making powers and responsibilities.
