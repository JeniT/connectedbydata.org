**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** was established in March 2022 as a campaigning organisation working to put community at the heart of data narratives, policy and practices, and to advocate for collective and open data governance. Since then, we’ve grown from a single founder and funder, to a team of six on two continents, attracted funding from seven more donors and clients, and are working on a growing range of research, practice and policy projects, almost all involving a range of UK or international partners.

Our work during the first year of operation has highlighted a useful role we could play in **building the field** through **convening, catalysing and supporting communities of practice and action**. As a consequence, we are looking for a **Field Building Associate** to drive, shape and support our engagement across civil society, participation practitioners, community groups, policymakers, innovators and researchers, both in the UK and internationally.

Our team consists of our founder and Executive Director, [Jeni Tennison](https://connectedbydata.org/people/jeni-tennison), our Director of Research, Director of Advocacy and Campaigns, two research associates and a policy and campaigns associate, and we are currently hiring a [Head of Delivery and Operations](https://connectedbydata.org/jobs/head-of-delivery-and-ops). We know we all have a role to play in engaging our networks and providing value, but given the importance of a stronger field in this space, we think we need someone dedicated to nurturing it and helping us to engage our communities more effectively. In some areas that will look like shaping and leading engagement activities. In other areas it will be supporting other members of the team as they build coalitions and plan events.

We recognise that the communities we’re part of don’t belong to us. We want our convening to be generous, enabling and nurturing, potentially going off in different directions to those we originally intended. Impact needs to be measured in what the communities we’re part of achieve together, not in what we – as an organisation – achieve through them.

Getting practical, our existing engagement ranges across the usual social media channels, our [website](https://connectedbydata.org/), a [Discord](https://discord.gg/uZyhRghzsc) server, targeted Signal groups and ad-hoc convening. During our first year of operation, we have held a range of successful virtual and in-person workshops and events. And we have a small fellowship community that meets regularly.

During the next year we want to step up our field building in three areas:

* convening a series of monthly **connected conversations** – short online roundtable events – creating a safe space for tackling the big questions in our field of collective data governance
* holding at least three 3-day-long **design labs** to co-create useful resources such as a narratives toolkit, materials to support public deliberation around data, and an international policy agenda
* expanding our **fellowship network** of early-to-mid career researchers, practitioners and professionals working in this space

The way we contribute to building the field needs to reflect our values. We want to focus on **impact**; to work in the **open**; to **collaborate** with and **learn** from others; to take the time to **care** for ourselves and each other; and to have **fun** together. Our work is founded on an awareness of power, privilege and pluralism inspired by feminism, intersectionality, and anti-colonialism. We want you to help us build these values into the communities we convene.

This is a great opportunity to influence the future of how data and AI works in our society, shape not just our organisation but also the wider ecosystem, work with a range of interesting people, and learn a lot on the way.
