We are recruiting an **Advocacy and campaign director** for **Connected by data**, where we have a mission to put community at the centre of data narratives, practices and policies. Our work will include research, engagement with others working in the space, public policy development, advocacy, and communications.

Your role will be a hands-on one, leading the **public advocacy** of this work with a goal of influencing public opinion, organisational commitments and political will. You will be responsible for devising and implementing our **campaign and communication strategy**, and **creating or procuring assets** such as content, graphics and video to support the campaign. We will work together to **shape and deliver our message** to the public and policymakers, actively contributing to the discussion of how data is collected, used and shared on mainstream and social media.

You will be the first hire into this team and will have a significant role in shaping the programme and organisation as the [Jeni's](http://localhost:4000/team/jeni-tennison.html) “partner in crime”[^1]. We will need to be aligned on our mission and values, but also complement each other so we can both play to our strengths.

The organisation aims to focus on the **impact** we want to have; work in the **open**; **collaborate** with and **learn** from others; take the time to **care** for each other, and ourselves; and have **fun** together. Jeni is strong on the substance of this work, strategic thinking, and building relationships with a range of stakeholders. She needs particular help with the art of campaigning, political awareness, and getting comfortable with bold, outsider-style comms.

This is a great opportunity to influence the future of how data works in our society, shape the culture of a new organisation, and learn a lot on the way.

## What else will you get?
