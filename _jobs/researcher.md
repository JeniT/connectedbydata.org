We are recruiting a **Researcher** for [Connected by data](https://connectedbydata.org), where we have a mission to put community at the centre of data narratives, practices and policies. Our work will include research, engagement with others working in the space, public policy development, advocacy, and communications. We are particularly interested in questions about when individualistic models such as data ownership fail, and how to adapt more participatory approaches of governance to the world of data.

Your role will unsurprisingly be focused on conducting research for Connected by data. During the year, you will spend about a third of your time focused on exploring and creating case studies about existing examples of participatory approaches to data governance. Another third will be spent building relationships with and collaborating with other researchers on more targeted quantitative and qualitative research around collective data governance. The remainder will be spent on more opportunistic research tasks in support of the development of our advocacy and public policy work.

You will be one of the first hires into this small team so in comparison to most roles of this type, you will have a big influence in shaping how projects run and the organisation works. You will work closely with and get a lot of support from [Jeni](https://connectedbydata.org/team/jeni-tennison), but have significant autonomy, opportunities for growth and chances for experimentation in the work you do.

This is a great opportunity to influence the future of how data works in our society, shape the culture of a new organisation, and learn a lot on the way.

## Who are you?

As our Researcher, you should have skills and experience in:

* Current research and hot topics in data, digital and AI, including data governance and preferably collective forms of data governance
* Qualitative and quantitative research methods including literature reviews, case study development, interviews, surveys, content and thematic analysis, data and statistical analysis
* Clear written and verbal communication for public and policy audiences, including the use of data visualisations
* Collaborative working, including across organisations
* Working in the open
* Investing in your own personal and professional development
* Preferably, work across a range of countries
* Preferably, project and budget management
* Preferably, with a good network

## What will you do?

In your first 6 months, you’ll:

* Create a register of examples of collective data governance in practice
* Interview people who have used participatory approaches with data
* Help select and then collaborate on two research projects led by other organisations
* Build relationships with other researchers working on the area
* Support the development of the organisation’s public policy positioning, messaging and narrative

## What else will you get?

Like the rest of the team, you’ll benefit from:

* flexible remote working with designated meeting-free days
* 5 weeks (25 days pro rata) holiday + bank holidays
* 3 days company-wide holiday between Christmas and New Year
* 5% employer pension contributions
* other perks to be determined in consultation

## What are the next steps?

If you are interested in this role, please send a CV and cover letter to [jeni@connectedbydata.org](mailto:jeni@connectedbydata.org) by 8am GMT Monday 28th March. The cover letter should describe your skills and experience against the criteria listed above, and why you are interested in the role.

If you have any questions about the role, or want to chat about it before applying, please get in touch with [jeni@connectedbydata.org](mailto:jeni@connectedbydata.org).

If you are not certain that you meet all the criteria, or want to explore a different working pattern, please consider applying anyway; there is some flexibility in the way this role could work. We are very open to job shares and other flexible working arrangements.

We would particularly like to see applications from people who are under-represented in current debates about data.
