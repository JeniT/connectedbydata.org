The CAF International Validated Organization Badge is awarded to organizations that are structured and operated as nonprofit entities. This is confirmed by [a validation process](https://validation.cafamerica.org/0fe3eed5-8382-490f-b01c-716d9d33f0bb#acc.5ogDt4WB) that goes far beyond a simple reliance on a foreign government database.
