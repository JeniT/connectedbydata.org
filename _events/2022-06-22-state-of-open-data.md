Renata: Open Data is the good seed. From which we can grow the data crops that let people lead better lives. Open data is the bare minimum. Contrast with genetically modified/proprietary seeds: creating famine, decreasing quality of life. Open data is sina non qua factor to have AI that is accountable, that we can shape, that can be collaborative - even if it operating in the private sector. 

Open data is a precondition for any AI system that would be fair, accountable and sustainable.
