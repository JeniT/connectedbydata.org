During a session of the 2022 Internet Governance Forum, Tim spoke to the launch of [a new paper on 'Data Governance and the Datasphere'](https://www.thedatasphere.org/datasphere-publish/data-governance-and-the-datasphere/), providing a bibliometric-driven literature review of academic and policy work on data governance.

Thes paper is one outcome of Tim's Fellowship at the Datasphere Initiative 2021/2022. It provides a preliminary mapping of academic literature on data governance and explores the emerging conceptual framework of the “Datasphere” and how it relates to current research.

> "In recent years, the term data governance has garnered growing attention. It has moved from being a niche topic, addressed solely as a technical aspect of data sharing projects, or within enterprise Information Communication Technology disciplines as a companion to data management, to becoming an umbrella for considering issues such as data protection and access to data. It has emerged as a key framework within which to address both the opportunities and the risks of data collection, sharing, and use. 
> 
> The paper finds that data governance is a growing, diverse field bringing together formerly distinct areas of focus. While research in this space is highly fragmented, work around computer science and health dominate. The publication provides a preliminary mapping and offers a baseline for further research in considering how the framework of the Datasphere can be useful for connecting different disciplines increasingly interested and impacted by data."
