Adam spoke on panel at the Wales TUC Annual Congress focusing on how trade unions are engaging with digitalisation and AI. Hosted by law firm Watkins and Gunn, Adam appeared alongside Tom Hoyle, President-elect of Wales TUC, Chloe Rees organising and development officer at Wales TUC and John James of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union.

At the Congress, a motion was passed on AI citing the Wales TUC and Connected by Data report ‘[A snapshot of workers in Wales’ understanding and experience of AI](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/snapshot-workers-wales-understanding-and-experience-ai)’.
