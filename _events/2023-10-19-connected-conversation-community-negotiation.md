In order to enter into negotiations about data, communities often need to be represented by constituted organisations. However, community is a fluid construct that is understood differently by different people, and definition can be limiting. Do communities need to be represented by organised, constituted groups with a set structure? Or can a loose, flexible understanding of community accommodate different forms of representation?

This conversation will bring together different perspectives of participatory work with communities, to discuss which community configurations are needed, or best suited, to negotiation in data governance.

This is part of a series of 'Connected Conversation' sessions we're running this autumn interrogating current practice, and critical gaps, in supporting communities to have a powerful voice in data governance. For each Connected Conversation we provide a short set of framing inputs, and then open to discussion between participants. The sessions are written up and key themes published on this website.  You can read recent writeups about '[public voices in AI](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-09-26-connected-conversation-public-voices-ai)' and '[collective data rights](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-09-27-connected-conversation-collective-data-rights)'. 

The conversation will take place on Zoom from 2-3pm (UK time) on Thursday 19 October 2023.  To register your attendance and receive the link, please [email Helena.](mailto:helena@connectedbydata.org)
