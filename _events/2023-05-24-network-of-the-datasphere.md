[Connected by Data is a partner of The Datasphere Initiative](https://www.thedatasphere.org/news/connected-by-data-joins-the-datasphere-initiative-as-an-in-kind-partner/), and we were pleased to be able to share [an update on our Strategic Roadmap](http://connectedbydata.org/resources/strategic-roadmap-2023-2024) and activities with Datasphere partners, as well as to learn about Datasphere Initiative plans to build on the [Data Governance Atlas](https://www.thedatasphere.org/programs/intelligence-hub/datasphere-governance-atlas/) with a living observatory, and to deepen work on Sandboxes for Data, and on developing modular protocols for data sharing.

Discussions in the session also underscored the importance of joining the dots between G20 agendas in India, Brazil and South Africa: something Connected by Data will be contributing to along with the Datasphere Initiative and other partners through an [upcoming Policy Design Lab workshop alongside RightsCon in Costa Rica](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7kub-QzB7Trid9t39pOoLOAp9qQfeVNHDavhMyJADs/edit).
