How can AI developers and decision-makers gain access to informed public input? What role can deliberative mini-publics play in shaping the future of AI?

<!--more-->

Join us for a fireside conversation with members of the People’s Panel on AI, and representatives from academia and civil society, for a practical conversation about placing public voice at the heart of AI decision making. 

The first half of this ‘[Connected Conversation](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-connected-conversations)’ session will involve input from our panellists, before opening to an opportunity for questions and discussions amongst all attendees.

This conversation will take place 14:00 - 15:00 UK time, Thursday 7 March 2024 on Zoom.
