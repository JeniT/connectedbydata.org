### HL BaSE Training

To kick off the programme our [Head of Delivery and Operations, Emily](https://connectedbydata.org/people/emily-macaulay), headed to London and the Offices of Hogan Lovells to meet the other social enterprises and entrepreneurs that form part of his year’s cohort, and meet the team that will be providing our legal advice as part of the programme.

Our strategic roadmap of what we want to achieve as an organisation includes how we want to contribute to building a strong community of those mobilising around the same issues and values as us.  Whilst not with a specific data and digital rights focus, when Hogan Lovells told us about their HL BaSE Training programme and the commitment they have to building the field of lawyers with social hearts and a deeper engagement with, and understanding of, social enterprise issues, then we knew we wanted to be part of supporting that work.

Over a six month period we’ll be working with a team of lawyers who are taking part in a mini-MBA style programme to develop their skills and we get some great advice too.

At the kick off event Emily met with the team that will be engaging with us and had good conversations about our missions, how we envisaged making the change we want to see and probing questions to see how they can best help us. We’re looking forward to seeing how the relationship develops.
