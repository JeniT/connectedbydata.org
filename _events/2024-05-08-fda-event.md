With the use of AI and data driven tools increasing in the civil service and by public servants, Adam spoke on a panel at the annual conference of the [FDA, the union representing public service managers and professionals](https://www.fda.org.uk/).

Appearing alongside a colleague from the TUC and in conversation with the FDA’s General Secretary, Adam discussed Connected by Data’s [work with TUC Cymru](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-tuc-cymru) and the implications of the [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources) for public service workers.
