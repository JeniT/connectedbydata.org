On 22nd - 24th November 2023 Connected by Data and Iswe convened a Design Sprint to create a toolkit for distributed deliberation on Artificial Intelligence. Following this, work has continued on a series of resources and projects to support practitioners in making the case for, and scaling delivery of, public deliberation on how AI impacts our lives.
