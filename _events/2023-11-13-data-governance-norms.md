## Introduction

From 2018 to 2023 the [Global Data Justice research programme](https://globaldatajustice.org/) explored an inclusive global conversation on data governance, engaging with groups across the world to explore how far current governance and rights frameworks match with people’s subjective needs. The work shone a light on the gulf between exploitative data practices, and those that could command public backing. This has led Siddharth de Souza & Linnet Taylor to advance the idea of developing new global norms. As they explain:

> “We take as a model the international norm-making and enforcement mechanisms used to outlaw unacceptable behaviour on the international scale, for instance apartheid, slavery, and (currently under construction) environmental crimes. Our argument is that we require the same kind of global red lines for illegitimate behaviour with data that we have for other forms of illegitimate behaviour.”

In this Connected Conversation we will hear from Siddharth and Linnet on the opportunity for new norms, before turning to learning from work-in-progress in the Stop Ecocide Campaign with Jojo Mehta.

### Presentation abstract: Rebooting the global consensus: norm entrepreneurship, data governance and the majority world

Siddharth de Souza & Linnet Taylor’s presentation will explore the question of whether it is possible to establish norms that ban illegitimate data-related practices at scale, given the global policy consensus that data must flow, and that extractive and exploitative practices performed through data are a necessary basis for innovation. They seek ways to re-norm datafication that can counter both illegitimate processes, as in cases such as those of Pegasus or  Cambridge Analytica, and illegitimate substantive effects, such as administrative violence performed at scale via digital infrastructures. Teyu take as a model the international norm-making and enforcement mechanisms used to outlaw unacceptable behaviour on the international scale, for instance apartheid, slavery, and (currently under construction) environmental crimes. Their argument is that we require the same kind of global red lines for illegitimate behaviour with data that we have for other forms of illegitimate behaviour.
