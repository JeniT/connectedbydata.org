On August 10th, I attended the first Think20 Brasil Mobilization Meeting (T20 Brasil), organised by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea) in partnership with the Alexandre de Gusmão Foundation (Funag) and the Brazilian Center for International Relations (Cebri). It was an effort to bring together representatives from think tanks, academic institutions, and civil society and share how the group will work during Brazil's rotating presidency of the G20 in 2024.

In 2017, the T20 Germany created a work dynamic that continues to be reproduced today: it began to organise itself into thematic task forces and to work on writing policy briefs, which produce a statement to be delivered to government authorities.

During the T20 Brasil meeting, organisers stated the three principles that will guide the groups’ work: inclusion, representativeness, and effectiveness of the T20 process. Familiarity with international discussions around task force topics and insertion into international knowledge production and dissemination networks are requirements for organisations to participate, as well as an engagement opportunity for researchers. A concept note on these principles was later published in September 2023.

The next meeting is expected to happen in early October 2023, as soon as Brazil releases its agenda for the next year. They expect the policy briefs and task forces’ recommendations to be published in June 2024.

This meeting kicked off my efforts around engagement for, and strategic reflection on how to foster and facilitate collective governance conversations at the G20 process. If you or your organisation are interested in talking about it, drop me a message!
