Data-driven technologies are seeing increasing adoption in education. But how are the stakeholders affected by this: from students and teachers, to parents and communities, involved in shaping decisions about it? That's the focus for our two-part online design lab in January.

By the end of this lab we aim to have:

* Produced a  map of some of the ways data and AI technologies are being used in schools, and how decisions are being made about them;
* Identified a set of policy and practice interventions that could enable affected communities to have more say in EdTech decision-making.
