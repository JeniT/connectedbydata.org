AI and digitalisation is rapidly changing how public services are delivered, with the government making the public sector use of AI a key priority. 

<!--more-->

Digital tools can make public services more accessible and efficient, but they can also embed bias, increase surveillance and lead to discrimination and injustice such as the devastating [Australian Robodebt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme) or [Dutch social security scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal).

We will introduce some of the key issues concerning the use of AI and digital tools in the provision of welfare and benefits, with the aim to help charities and campaigners understand how to best engage with this fast moving area. We will also provide details on a new forum for civil society and activists working on this issue.

_This event is jointly hosted by Big Brother Watch, Public Law Project and Connected by Data._

> This event will take place on Zoom from 1-2pm (UK time) on Tuesday 3 December 2024.
