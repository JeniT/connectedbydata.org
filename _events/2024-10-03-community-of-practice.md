On Thursday 3 October 2024, on Zoom from 2 - 3:15pm, we will hold the second meeting of a community of practice as part of our project on **[Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake)** projects.

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing **[data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/)**, and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

On 3 October we will hear from:
* Dr. Michaela Omelkova, Data Ethics Advisor, Scottish Government, on their [public](https://www.gov.scot/publications/public-dialogue-use-data-public-sector-scotland/) [dialogues](https://www.gov.scot/publications/public-dialogue-data-sharing-outside-public-sector-scotland/) on data and CivTech challenge on the [use of technology in public participation on the use of data and AI](https://www.civtech.scot/civtech-10-challenge-7-public-participation-in-decision-making), plus Q&A
* Several education-based initiatives:
    * Edward O'Garro-Priddie, Delivery Lead, and Jake Luscombe, Senior Data Scientist, Faculty, on the[ AI in Education Hackathon](https://faculty.ai/blog/key-insights-from-the-ai-in-education-hackathon/)
    * Dea Begaj, Public Attitudes Researcher, and Sylvie Hobden, Head of Public Attitudes, Responsible Technology Adoption Unit, on [research on parent and pupil attitudes towards the use of AI in education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-on-parent-and-pupil-attitudes-towards-the-use-of-ai-in-education)
    * Fay Skevington, Digital Strategy, Department for Education, on how collaborative engagement on data has shaped policymaking
