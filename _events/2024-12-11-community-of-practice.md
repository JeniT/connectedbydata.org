On Wednesday 11 December 2024 at 2pm we will hold the third meeting of a community of practice – an online workshop – as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects.

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

In our [first](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-community-of-practice) and [second](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-03-community-of-practice) events, we had presentations from practitioners engaging the public. Our third event will be a bit different, following suggestions we’ve received about what would be helpful – an online workshop on the question, **what do public engagement practitioners need to succeed?**

This will explore:
* The challenges and barriers practitioners face in engaging the public on data and AI
* What resources would be most useful, and what already exists, to help overcome these barriers and support practitioners.

There will be future meetings (all online, Wednesdays at 2pm - 3:15pm) on:
* 15 January
* 12 February
* 12 March
