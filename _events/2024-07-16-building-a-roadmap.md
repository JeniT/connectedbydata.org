To answer this question, we worked alongside [Promising Trouble](https://www.promisingtrouble.net/), the [Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge and [ZoomInfo](http://zoominfo.com) to bring together more than 60 representatives from civil society, academia, industry, policy and government.
