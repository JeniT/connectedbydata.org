On Thursday 25th May 2023, **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** and [Future Narratives Lab](https://www.futurenarrativeslab.org/) held a narrative design lab workshop, bringing together invited experts to start the co-creation of a strategy for shifting the inaccurate, damaging way data is currently framed & understood in media, policy and industry narratives. 

The session followed a process of identifying problems, exploring promising solutions, and identifying opportunities for action. Discussions took place through three distinct tracks focussing on policy and politics, media, and industry.
