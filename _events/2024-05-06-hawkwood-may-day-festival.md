Tim spoke at the Hawkwood Centre for Future Thinking May Day Festival, alongside [Jeremy Chapman](https://www.hawkwoodcollege.co.uk/event/integrity-centre/) and [Penny Hay](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/our-people/penny-hay/), chaired by Alicia Carey, CEO of Hawkwood. 

The panel explored the connection between Hawkwood fellows' work on imagination, public engagement, integrity and futures thinking.

Tim reflects:

> "Over 45 minutes we had an incredibly rich discussion, exploring the critical role of interdisciplinary practice and both local and global action to address interlinked challenges of climate breakdown, opaque and distorted financial systems, and the democratisation of control over technologies such as AI. 
>
> My fellowship time at Hawkwood has provided a great space to explore some of the connections between global work on public engagement around climate change, and the growing field of public engagement around data and AI, as well as to test out ideas for local practices that can empower communities to make more conscious choices about the kinds of data and AI futures they want to create."
