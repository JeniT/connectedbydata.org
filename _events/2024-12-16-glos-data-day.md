We supported the second [Gloucestershire data day](https://dataday.org.uk/) in December 2024 as a local, place based, example of convening around data.  

<!--more-->

The day aimed to:
* Build confidence in understanding and working with data: exploring language, skills and approaches that take the fear out of stats and spreadsheets
* Take a creative approach to engaging with data collection and use - moving beyond spreadsheets and stats, from storage to storytelling
* Create connections between individuals and organisations in Gloucestershire with data to share and those with data needs
* Generate ideas together for how data could work better for all
* Get critical about the power of data, and how to put communities in control

Tim attended on behalf of Connected by Data and, in addition to general participation, led a workshop on our [Community Campaigns on Data](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities) Toolkit too. This was an interactive session giving people space and support to engage with [the toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit#heading=h.jgmduqp1336). Tim will be iterating the workshop based on learning from this session.

Beyond the Connected by Data workshop the day was jam packed with content including:
* Lightning talks from [Tiziana Alocci](https://www.tizianaalocci.com/data-visualization-resources/) from [NECESSITY.INK](https://necessity.ink/) on sonification of data; Adam Cormack on the [Tree Equity Score](https://uk.treeequityscore.org/); Siobhan Farmer on taking a critical approach to data (with cartoons from [Timo Elliott](https://timoelliott.com/blog/cartoons/analytics-cartoons)); and Madeline Spinks on the [Data Orchard Data Maturity Assessment](https://www.dataorchard.org.uk/data-maturity-assessment-tool).
* A “Dash Battle” with presentations about a range of data dashboards such as the [Gloucestershire Digi Hubs](https://www.gloucestershire-digital-hubs.co.uk/), NHS Joining up Insight in Gloucestershire (JIG) on the Future NHS Platform and [Rustik CCRI Smart Dashboard platform](https://ccri.ac.uk/research-projects/11/2022/rural-sustainability/). Organisers also demonstrated the [Local Intelligence Hub](https://www.localintelligencehub.com/) created by the Climate Coalition.
* An open space where attendees explored engaging young people in shaping data collection, co-analysis to understand data gaps, the importance of getting data sharing collaborations right, and the promise and pitfalls of presenting data through stories. There is a summary set of slides here on the [dataday website 2024 resources page](https://dataday.org.uk/2024-resources-blog-posts/blog-post-title-four-pdl6b-mmg2n-jpkph).
* A breadth of workshops including:
    * Creating - textile, audio and poetic expressions of data. A response to [Biodiversity Stripes data visualisation](https://biodiversitystripes.info/global), produced a powerful collective sonnet, '[Facing the Grey](https://dataday.org.uk/2024-resources-blog-posts/blog-post-title-four-pdl6b-mmg2n)', and live stitched evaluation with [Amanah Community CIC](https://www.aysharandera.com/amanah-community-cic) and [Making Place](https://www.makingplace.co.uk/).
    * Learning - getting the latest on data from [Arts Council England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/illuminate), looking at lessons from charity and local authority collaborations, and looking at how data can change policy.
    * Exploring - looking at approaches to inclusive evaluation with [Barnwood Trust](https://www.barnwoodtrust.org/) and [Creative Sustainability](https://cscic.org/)

The event had a  “keynote listener”, Malaki Patterson, who offered reflections on the day and challenged everyone to think differently about data. Read the full text on the [2024 resources page](https://dataday.org.uk/resources-2024) on the dataday website.

> "As I close my reflections I’ve been struck by a powerful parallel. When communities are repeatedly asked to complete surveys without seeing tangible change, it's like being invited to share your story but never getting to read the final chapter. Today has challenged me to think differently about how we approach data. Perhaps the real question isn't 'What data do we need to collect?' but rather 'What change are we trying to create?'"
