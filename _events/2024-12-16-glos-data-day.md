Join us at Gloucestershire’s 2nd data day. (#GlosDataDay)

<!--more-->

Do you have ideas about how we could use data better in our communities and want to collaborate?

Come along for a day of creative, practical and critical conversations around data …and what it means for you...

[Create Gloucestershire](https://www.creategloucestershire.co.uk/), Connected by Data, [Age UK Gloucestershire](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/gloucestershire/), [Active Gloucestershire](https://www.activegloucestershire.org/) & [Barnwood Trust](https://www.barnwoodtrust.org/) are planning a one day event for anyone taking part or working in communities across Gloucestershire to:
* Build confidence in understanding and working with data: exploring language, skills and approaches that take the fear out of stats and spreadsheets
* Take a creative approach to engaging with data collection and use - moving beyond spreadsheets and stats, from storage to storytelling
* Create connections between individuals and organisations in Gloucestershire with data to share and those with data needs
* Generate ideas together for how data could work better for all
* Get critical about the power of data, and how to put communities in control
