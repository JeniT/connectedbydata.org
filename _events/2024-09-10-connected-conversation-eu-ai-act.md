## "Nothing About Us, Without Us?"

As the dust settles on the legislative process of the EU’s AI Act, the focus is now on its implementation and enforcement. 

<!--more-->

The EU has developed [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai), including principles such as transparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, and social and environmental well-being. It has established new governance mechanisms, such as the [European AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office), Scientific Panel and multi-stakeholder Advisory Forum, which will play a key role in implementing the Act and in fostering the development and use of “_human-centric and trustworthy AI_” within Europe and globally. EU Member States have been tasked with establishing or designating competent national authorities to oversee the Act’s implementation at the national level.

Effectively governing AI will require involving and empowering people and affected communities in designing, developing, and deploying digital technologies and the policies intended to regulate them. Strengthening networks of civil society actors working across the digital rights and social justice domains will be critical for ensuring that the benefits of AI are equitable, leaving no one behind, and significant harms are not overlooked.

In this Connected Conversation, we will explore the opportunities for meaningful community and public participation in the governance and implementation of the EU’s AI Act. 

**When:** Tuesday 10 September 2024, 13:00-14:00 CET
**Where:** Zoom
