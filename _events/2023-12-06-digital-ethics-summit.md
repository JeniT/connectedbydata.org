On Wednesday 6 December 2023, [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/) and partners brought together world leading academics, philosophers, lawyers, technology experts, policy makers and other key stakeholders at [techUK’s seventh Digital Ethics Summit](https://www.techuk.org/digital-ethics-summit-2023-seizing-the-moment.html). 

We were delighted to attend the event with members of our [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai) to open the Summit with a fireside chat about the process, learnings and the [Panel's recommendations](http://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/11/03/peoples-panel-bulletin-5).
