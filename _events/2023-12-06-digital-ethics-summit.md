At this crucial moment in the AI conversation where ethical issues raised by AI have become the global news story discussed in parliaments, offices, schools and homes, this year’s Summit has never been more important. During the Digital Ethics Summit 2023 attendess will evaluate where we are right now, analyse how we shape what comes next, and agree how we can seize this moment to build the right policy, governance and regulatory frameworks and ensure the responsible use of these technologies.

We are pleased to have been invited to attend this Summit with members of our [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai) to open the Summit with a fireside chat about the process, learnings and the [Panel's recommendations](http://connectedbydata.org/news/2023/11/03/peoples-panel-bulletin-5).  Later in the day our Research and Practice Director, Tim Davies, will be speaking in a breakout session about "Public engagement and democratising access to AI".
