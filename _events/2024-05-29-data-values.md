Tim will be speaking alongside partners from the [Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](https://www.data4sdgs.org/) on May 29, 9-10am EST for a virtual session on participatory data governance.

<!--more-->

People must be included in decisions about how their data is used, shared, and re-used, the #DataValues Manifesto states. But this is easier said than done. In the context of complex data ecosystems, how can individuals have a meaningful say in decisions made by policy makers or businesses about their data? 

This interactive session will surface inspiring stories from Data Values partners of how people have meaningfully engaged in data governance. Join the Data Values community and friends to hear from researchers and practitioners on ground-breaking approaches to ensuring people have a say in decisions made about their data.
