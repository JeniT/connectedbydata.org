Digitalisation within the public sector continues at pace. UK Labour is strongly signalling a technology-driven strategy for wide ranging public services reform and a significant role for private sector vendors. 

In order to shape public sector digitalisation towards fair and equitable outcomes for workers and communities alike, a range of voices and perspectives need to be meaningfully incorporated at all stages.

Public sector procurement processes of data and AI systems are a key leverage point for influencing whether and how digital technologies are introduced into public sector workplaces. However, as has previously been [stated by the TUC](https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-05/TUC%20response%20on%20Transforming%20Public%20Procurement%20FINAL.pdf), workers and unions have too often been marginalised from these processes. As found in the Wales TUC and Connected by Data report, excluding workers not only leads to potential weakening of pay and conditions but also to [poorly delivered initiatives](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/snapshot-workers-wales-understanding-and-experience-ai) due to not drawing on the insight of workers of how services actually work in practice. On the contrary, [evidence suggests](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740624X21001003) that meaningful engagement with workers leads to better outcomes overall.

Through the social partnership agenda in Wales, the trade union movement has significant opportunities to enhance the rights and interests of workers - who may be subject to as well as deploy data and AI systems - through proactive engagement with procurement processes. Inspired by the Welsh example, UK Labour have [stated an intention](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LABOURS-PLAN-TO-MAKE-WORK-PAY.pdf) to incorporate social value and workers rights concerns into a National Procurement Plan.

Internationally, significant developments are seeking to ensure workers are active stakeholders in procurement decisions. Most significantly, the Biden Whitehouse’s Executive Order and related guidance for federal agencies, [provides opportunities for unions](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/what-workers-and-unions-stand-to-gain-from-recent-executive-orders-on-artificial-intelligence/) to shape public sector use of AI. California’s Governor Newsom [ordered](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/09/06/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-to-prepare-california-for-the-progress-of-artificial-intelligence/) public sector institutions to examine the “most significant, potentially beneficial use cases for deployment of GenAI tools by the State” in collaboration with the workforce and representatives, leading to [the publication of guidelines](https://www.govops.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/03/3.a-GenAI-Guidelines.pdf). [Legislation is progressing](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024258/ai-bill-unethical-ai-california-ban-regulation) within the California legislature to put this on a stronger and statutory footing, seeking to limit public sector agencies from contracting with unethical AI companies or those who do not comply with standards. 

With these examples and many more, the role of public procurement of AI in  supporting good governance is an emerging and complex field. This Design Lab brings together a range of stakeholders and diverse expertise to examine the challenges and opportunities in Wales, centring on how workers and trade unions can leverage procurement to protect and enhance worker’s rights and the integrity of public services.  

**When:** Tuesday 15 October 2024, 1:30 - 4:30pm.
