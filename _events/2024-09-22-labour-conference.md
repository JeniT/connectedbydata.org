_What’s Civil Society got to do with tech policy? Aren’t they the wreckers, the luddites, the always-questioning-never solving people?_

Power in the tech ecosystem needs rebalancing. Good AI governance is not an inhibitor of innovation. Including a plurality of perspectives and diverse opportunity encourages innovation, improves resilience, and helps build a fairer society in which we all share in the benefits of new technologies.

Because whether its workers’ rights in the age of AI, competition and opportunity for UK SMEs, public services and automation, or the environmental impact of LLMs, tech policy is not merely a technical or neutral issue.

This networking event brings together leading civil society voices with Startup Coalition to map new ways forward for a flourishing UK tech ecosystem that works for all. 

We welcome sceptics and fellow travellers alike to join us for a relaxed reception with robust collegial conversation on the role of civil society in tech policy_. _

Come join us for networking, drinks and a special speaker!

_This event is occurring outside Labour Party Conference 2024. You do not need tickets to the Conference to attend, but the event is designed to complement the conference._
