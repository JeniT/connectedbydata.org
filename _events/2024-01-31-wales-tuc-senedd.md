### Event overview
At this Senedd event, hosted by the Wales TUC and Connected by Data, workers from different sectors will be in conversation with Members of the Senedd and policy specialists.

Rooted in the big questions, this event will bring together a wide range of perspectives – from the power of lived experience to policy expertise and political decision making – all focused on ensuring a fair technological transition in the workplace.

We are hoping for a lively debate that reflects the challenges and urgency of this issue.
