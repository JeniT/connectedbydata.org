**Event overview**
On 31st January 2024 we hosted an event at the Senedd, with the Wales TUC and Connected by Data, to enable workers from different sectors to be in conversation with Members of the Senedd and policy specialists.

Rooted in the big questions, this event brought together a wide range of perspectives – from the power of lived experience to policy expertise and political decision making – all focused on ensuring a fair technological transition in the workplace.
