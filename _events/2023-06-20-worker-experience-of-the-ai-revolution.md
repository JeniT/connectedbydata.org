Not a day goes by where data and AI isn't in the news. Yet the most prominent voices tend to be tech CEOs, often overly focused on remote and extreme threats. 

With the constant media attention, the progress of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill and the debate on AI regulation, it's crucial that a range of voices are heard. Including those that reveal the real and present impacts of data-driven tech and AI. This is no more evident than in the workplace and for workers. 

At this event, hosted by the Trades Union Congress and **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**, workers from different sectors will be in conversation with cross-party parliamentarians and policy specialists. 

This event will bring together a wide range of perspectives – from the power of lived experience to policy expertise and political decision making – all focused on ensuring a fair technological transition in the workplace.
