### How can community-led campaigns transform the way data is collected, managed, shared and used?

On 20 June 2024 we brought together a number of different community campaigns, along with our [Community Data Campaigns Cohort](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities) to work through a series of prototype practical activities designed to accelerate community campaigning on data, helping to shape campaigning strategies, while contributing to shared resources that can support future campaigning.

Working with [FabRiders](https://www.fabriders.net/), we put together this one day workshop for individuals and organisations running, or planning, campaigns to change practices around data - from securing change in national statistics, to stopping collection of biometrics, or shifting who has access to data on rented housing.

### About the team

The design lab was facilitated by FabRiders and **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**.
* **FABRIDERS** is run by Dirk Slater, focussed on facilitating capacity & movement building. Dirk is currently stewarding development of the [Collective Power Playbook](https://collectivepower.net/), and activities created for this design lab will build on, and feed into, Collective Power Playbook development.

* **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** is the campaign for communities to have a powerful voice in the governance of data and AI. Weâ€™ve been running a [cohort of community campaigns on data](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), exploring the approaches and resources needed to shift data power. The Connected by Data team will include [Helena Hollis](https://connectedbydata.org/people/helena-hollis), [Adam Cantwell-Corn](https://connectedbydata.org/people/adam-cantwell-corn) and and [Tim Davies](https://connectedbydata.org/people/tim-davies).
