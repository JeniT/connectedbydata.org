### How can community-led campaigns transform the way data is collected, managed, shared and used?

Join us to work through a series of prototype practical activities designed to accelerate community campaigning on data, helping you to shape your own campaigning strategies, while contributing to shared resources that can support future campaigning.

<!--more-->

Working with [FabRiders](https://www.fabriders.net/), we’re putting together this free one day workshop for** individuals and organisations running, or planning, campaigns to change practices around data** - from securing change in national statistics, to stopping collection of biometrics, or shifting who has access to data on rented housing.

**When:** Thursday 20 June 2024, 10am - 4pm
**Where:** Amnesty International's [Human Rights Action Centre](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/room-hire-and-public-spaces) at [25 New Inn Yard, London EC2A 3EA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oaX1PdeLH8pvGJkQ8).

### What to expect

We’re aiming to bring together around 15 different campaigns with a focus on data. Through the day you will have the opportunity to learn from each other, and to work through practical activities on:

* Mapping data stakeholders, communities and campaign objectives
* Exploring different strategic and tactical ‘plays’ for your data campaign
* Facilitating community action on data in ways that build solidarity and break down hierarchies

We will be gathering feedback on each activity, to help us refine these as resources to support future campaigns. 

By the end of the day we hope that you will have identified practical steps forward for your own campaign, as well as gaining inspiration and insights from other campaigns. 

You can come on your own, or with up to two other people from your campaign’s team. 

### About the team

The design lab will be facilitated by FabRiders and **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**.
* **FABRIDERS** is run by Dirk Slater, focussed on facilitating capacity & movement building. Dirk is currently stewarding development of the [Collective Power Playbook](https://collectivepower.net/), and activities created for this design lab will build on, and feed into, Collective Power Playbook development.

* **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** is the campaign for communities to have a powerful voice in the governance of data and AI. We’ve been running a [cohort of community campaigns on data](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), exploring the approaches and resources needed to shift data power. The Connected by Data team will include [Helena Hollis](https://connectedbydata.org/people/helena-hollis), [Adam Cantwell-Corn](https://connectedbydata.org/people/adam-cantwell-corn) and and [Tim Davies](https://connectedbydata.org/people/tim-davies).
