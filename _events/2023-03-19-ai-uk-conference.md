Research, data science and AI aim to improve our lives â€“ but they are often designed, developed and deployed without us. Citizen science and social campaigns are changing that.

AutSPACES (a platform for autistic people to share their lived experiences) and **CONNECTED** BY **DATA** will lead a thought-provoking session, entitled 'Nothing About Us Without Us', exploring how participatory methods are successfully applied to transform data subjects into agents; building trust and empowering communities, organisations and people to have a say and make decisions about data.
