As AI is increasingly rolled out in the workplace, a key need is for effective training and learning for trade unionists to shape, resist or use AI and related digital technologies.

In particular, as found in the Wales TUC and Connected by Data report ‘[A snapshot of workers in Wales](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/snapshot-workers-wales-understanding-and-experience-ai?page=11#section_header)’ understanding and experience of AI’, trade union training and education on AI should be tailored to the needs and experience of workers. This includes introductory, sector and technology specific materials and training on how AI and digital intersect with familiar means of negotiation, for example equalities, health and safety, pay and conditions.

In this two hour workshop by Wales TUC and Connected by Data, we will map and scope what is needed when developing learning materials for trade unionists in Wales. This will feed into a wider review of union learning programmes currently underway. 

Participants will include trade union tutors, reps and officers and contributors from academia, international unions and civil society. 

**When:** Tuesday 9th July, 1 - 3pm
**Where:** Online.
