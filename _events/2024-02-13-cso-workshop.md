A free virtual workshop for civil society and campaigners to get to grips with how data and AI affects your areas.

**Tuesday 13th February 2024 from 2.00-3.30pm UK time**

> Register [here](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYpcuqorTspGdGgHIoSMVgXgomliwXiuFLQ) to join the session via Zoom. 

## What’s it about?

Almost every modern policy reform relies on new data systems, and increasingly involves technologies labelled as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make and shape decisions. Whether that’s education, health, benefits, housing, social care, work, policing, democratic engagement or a multitude of other areas.

How that data flows, and how AI is used, is determined by data policy. Right now the UK government is debating controversial reforms to GDPR reducing citizens' data rights, affecting areas such as Subject Access Requests, Impact Assessments, human oversight of automated decisions and as well as much more.

The government is also opting for a hands off approach to AI, with few new resources or powers planned to enable a robust regulatory regime.

At the same time AI is being promoted as a ‘wonder’ solution to many public and private sector challenges - often driven by the interests of Big Tech. Yet the devastating [Australian Robodebt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme) or [Dutch social security scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal) show how badly this can go wrong.

Join us for this short practical and interactive workshop to explore:
* How data and AI regulation shape policy reforms in the delivery of public services, benefits, democratic engagement and many other areas
* The current policy and political landscapes and how it might be changing including the new [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/dpdib-resources) and forthcoming AI White Paper.
* The opportunity and need for civil society action

## Who is this session for?
The session is targeted at people working in a range of civil society and campaigning organisations who want to better understand how data and AI may affect their area of focus and the communities they work with.

The session will give an accessible introduction to those with a general level of knowledge of the issues, focusing on how current data driven and AI systems affect people and relevant policy areas, and provide an opportunity to discuss campaigning approaches on those issues.

Practically, it will particularly look at the new data legislation going through Parliament and how data and AI policy  issues are likely to feature in the coming General Election.

## Who else is taking part?
We will  be running a set of focused breakout groups as part of the workshop facilitated by a range of specialist organisations working in this field. These include:

**Data and AI are changing how we access public services and the welfare state**
_Facilitated by Public Law Project_
Increasingly the public services we all rely on and interact with day to day are shaped by data and AI. Whether that’s when receiving welfare benefits, in policing or in the NHS. 

But there is a severe lack of transparency and safeguards around the use of data and AI tools in government and the wider public sector. This raises the potential for harm and injustice to occur. For example, the government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill includes a controversial provision to snoop directly into people’s bank accounts under the guise of detecting benefits fraud. 

This breakout digs into how public services are being automated and data driven. 

**Data and AI often affects us as communities. How can we exercise collective rights and build community power?**
_Facilitated by Dr Jeni Tennison, Connected by Data_
To shift the power balance towards communities, we need ways to exercise rights over data and AI as groups and communities.

But much of the current law only gives us limited individual rights that are hard to exercise in practice due to resource and practical constraints. 

We’ll look at the tools for collective rights that do exist, and what could be done to strengthen community power over data and AI. 

**The justice system, and our access to justice, is being changed by data and AI**
_Facilitated by Dr Natalie Byrom_
Data driven and AI technologies are increasingly a feature of our justice system and legal services landscape. Yet how this affects the issues and communities we work with is not widely known.

Dr Natalie Byrom, an expert in justice system reform and data-driven technologies will introduce how these changes impact access to justice, particularly for those who already struggle to secure their rights, and your issues of concern.

**The government is trying to restrict your right to know what information is held on you**
_Facilitated by Open Rights Group_
Whether you have been ‘robo-fired’ in the gig economy or feel you have been unfairly treated by a public authority, a Subject Access Requests (SARs) gives you the ability to obtain information held about you. 

SARs provide a powerful tool for transparency to finding out what data is held about individuals and what decisions have been made. But now the government is seeking to roll back these rights in the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill.

This breakout will explore more about what rights the public have, potential changes and what we might do about them.	

**Data and AI are changing how people engage with democracy? [tbc]**
_Facilitated by Gavin Freeguard, Policy Associate at Connected By Data and the Institute for Government_
From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to AI generated misinformation to predicting voter behaviour, AI and data are changing our democracy. How the use of data and AI is regulated and shaped in the future is going to be vital. Yet in recent additions to their Data Protection Legislation, the Government is proposing [loosening the regulation](https://www.ft.com/content/3ed68928-b727-48ae-91a7-993508d9398b) for the sort of data driven voter targeting that lies behind mass digital and social media political marketing campaigns. 

This breakout explores how data and AI policy may affect democratic engagement, what these sort of legislative changes might mean and what sort of regulation we might campaign for in the future
