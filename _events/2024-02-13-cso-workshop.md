Almost every modern policy reform relies on new data systems, and increasingly involves technologies labelled as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make and shape decisions. Whether that’s education, health, benefits, housing, social care, work, policing, democratic engagement or a multitude of other areas.

How that data flows, and how AI is used, is determined by data policy. Right now the UK government is debating controversial reforms to GDPR reducing citizens' data rights, affecting areas such as Subject Access Requests, Impact Assessments, human oversight of automated decisions and as well as much more.

The government is also opting for a hands off approach to AI, with few new resources or powers planned to enable a robust regulatory regime.

At the same time AI is being promoted as a ‘wonder’ solution to many public and private sector challenges - often driven by the interests of Big Tech. Yet the devastating [Australian Robodebt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme) or [Dutch social security scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal) show how badly this can go wrong.

We hosted a free online session targeted at people working in a range of civil society and campaigning organisations who want to better understand how data and AI may affect their area of focus and the communities they work with.
