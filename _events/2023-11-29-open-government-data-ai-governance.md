This Connected Conversation on Zoom will present the [outcomes of a workshop convened alongside the 2023 OGP Summit](http://connectedbydata.org/events/2023-09-04-open-government-committment-lab) that developed a set of targetted and robust model open government commitments on transparency, participation and redress in data and AI governance. 

<!--more-->

It will set out the potential for open government actions that focus on:

1. **Participatory oversight of technology procurement** through creation of multi-stakeholder oversight groups that are empowered to advise, question and publicly report on public sector data and AI procurement. 
2. **Deliberative development of data and AI strategies** at both national and local levels through use of both open, and more targeted, participation processes.
3. **Strengthening citizen voice within sectoral regulators** to create a robust feedback loop and ensure data and AI firms have social licence to operate

We will present each of these commitment ideas, and will invite a panel of respondents to provide additional insights on how these ideas might be put into practice.
