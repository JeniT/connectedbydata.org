Described as an “essential part of [a data processor’s] accountability obligations” [by the ICO](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/what-is-a-dpia/), Data Protection Impact Assessments are intended to support the identification and preemption of harms prior to data processing, and are a key piece of evidence for effectively contesting processes or decisions by companies, the government and other data processors.

As with other aspects of the Data Protection Act 2018 (implementing the GDPR) the [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-04/0001/230001.pdf) rolls back the strength of DPIAs, replacing it with a narrower provision for the ‘Assessment of high risk processing’. 

As the Bill heads for the House of Lords, join us for a focused conversation on the implications and potential responses.

The Public Law Project and Institute for the Future of Work will first briefly present on impact assessments, before breaking out for group discussion.

The session will close with the opportunity to discuss and share general information on Data and AI policy.

This Zoom hosted conversation will take place on Wednesday 5 December from 2pm - 3:30pm (UK time).  To access the link and agenda [please click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_xloZbL5MsMXX8aJTAzsRGXqb6KjSDjcmfH1_MpPeg/edit?usp=sharing).
