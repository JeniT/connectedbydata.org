On Friday 11 October 2024 Adam will be delivering a workshop at the [TUC Union Ops Connect conference](https://tuc.zohobackstage.com/UnionOpsConnect2024#/?lang=en). Adam, and attendees, will be exploring "Trade unions as employers and deployers of AI". 

As with any organisation, AI can provide benefits to unions in their operations as employers and organisations. Yet the uncertainties and complexities of the technology demands careful consideration to develop best practice in the use of AI. In this short session we will discuss key concepts and considerations for unions
considering introducing AI into the workplace, with a focus on getting the process right so that the technology serves the goals of the union and its workforce.
