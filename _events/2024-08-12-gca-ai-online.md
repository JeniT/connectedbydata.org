Join us for this interactive online workshop on [Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-gca-ai). 

<!--more-->

Over 90 minutes we will:

* Introduce the work of the Coalition for a Global Citizens Assembly, and the case for a Global Citizen Assembly on AI;
* Explore a range of potential approaches to creating initiatives or institutions that put public voice at the heart of AI governance;
* Invite participant perspectives on these approaches, and critical issues to address in the design of any future assembly.

This session will build on an updated draft of the Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI paper, and will feed into the final draft of this paper, to be launched alongside the Coalition for a Global Citizens Assembly in New York in September.
