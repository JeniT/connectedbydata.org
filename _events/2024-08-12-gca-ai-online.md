project: Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI
---

We held an interactive online workshop on [Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-gca-ai). 

<!--more-->

Over 90 minutes we:

* Introduced the work of the Coalition for a Global Citizens Assembly, and the case for a Global Citizen Assembly on AI;
* Explored a range of potential approaches to creating initiatives or institutions that put public voice at the heart of AI governance;
* Invited participant perspectives on these approaches, and critical issues to address in the design of any future assembly.

This session will built on a draft of the Options for a Global Citizens Assembly on AI paper, and fed into the final draft of this paper.
