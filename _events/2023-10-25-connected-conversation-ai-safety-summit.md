The week before the UK's AI Safety Summit we hosted a more closed Connected Conversation (to enable a safe space for honest conversation). The attendees, largely from civil society organisations, discussed the framing of the Summit and how "safety" is defined.  

The notes of this connected conversation are only shared with participants.
