The [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai) is bringing together 12 diverse members of the public to attend, observe and discuss Fringe events. Hear the Panel's reflections and recommendations from the week at **12:30 UK time on Friday 3rd November**.

After engaging with the [AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/), looking at the outcomes of the [AI Safety Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction), and talking to experts about their hopes and fears for AI, what priorities do members of the public have for the future governance of AI?

Join us in person or online to hear the reflections and recommendations of the People's Panel on AI, and to explore what their messages might mean for your work.

**More about the Panel**

The [People’s Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai) will bring together 12 representative members of the public randomly selected by the [Sortition Foundation](https://www.sortitionfoundation.org/) to attend, observe and discuss key Fringe events. Through a deliberative process facilitated by [Hopkins Van Mil](http://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/), they will produce a public report giving their verdict on AI and their recommendations to government, industry, civil society and academia for further action.

The deliberative approach offers a chance to dig deeper than polling or public attitude surveys, providing insight and understanding of the considered opinion of individuals from across the country on how AI may affect them, and what should be done about it.
