## About the event

As we wait for the date for the second reading of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, we know lots of organisations have different concerns and interests, and can see different opportunities and risks in the Bill, as it starts to make its way through parliament again.

The workshop aims to bring together different people from across civil society to share information, understand what these concerns and opportunities might be, and discuss how we might work together to influence the Bill and then into the manifestos for the next general election.

At **Connected By Data** we think the Bill presents a real opportunity to influence how data is democratically and participatively governed and works for us all, as part of the UKs post-GDPR future. However, we also fear that, in its present form, it could potentially reduce individual citizens’ control and influence, remove transparency and key safeguards, limit opportunities for engagement and importantly ignore evidence about the collective and equality impacts of data processing and AI.

What do you think? Come along and share your thoughts


## Who is it for?

Whether you are interested in, or work on, hard issues affecting communities where data plays a part, or the future of democracy or technology, or how to improve data governance, we hope you will join us to explore how all our work can connect up to win change.

## Want to lead a session?

During the workshop, there will be space for 25 minute breakout sessions. If you would like to run such a breakout, or suggest a topic for one, please complete the form **[here](https://airtable.com/shrFgfOMvrCEHESGB)** – where you can also share any areas of the Bill you’re particularly interested in.

## How do I join?

The workshop is free and you can register [here](https://airtable.com/shrFgfOMvrCEHESGB). We’ll send you a zoom link for the event once you have registered.

You can also tell us if you’re not coming on the form, but would like to hear what happened and keep in touch with how the work develops.

After the event, we will also publish a short non-attributed summary of the discussions.
