In this conversation, we will share findings from and have a wider discussion about the implications of "Our Health Data Stories"; a report written by Just Treatment and Connected by Data. The report aims to bring out the personal stories of a range of patients as they encounter, think about, and respond to health data collection and use, to ground understanding and action in lived experience and help deliver person-centred care. It exposes how patients think about data on a day-to-day basis, and how this affects their approach to their health data and the way they use health services. And it recommends further work around data opt-outs, data service procurement, community engagement, and digital health apps.

This Connected Conversation is an invitation for more in-depth discussion around the current context in UK policy, the state of play within the NHS, and in light of the upcoming general election considering what action is needed, and by who, to make health data collection and use meet patientsâ€™ concerns and needs? If you are interested in joining the conversation, contact [Helena](mailto:helena@connectedbydata.org)
