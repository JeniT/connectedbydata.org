[CADA and Autonomy](https://autonomy.work/cada/) are partnering with [The World Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/) to bring you… Tech Transformed! Running for two days on May 25th and 26th in London, Tech Transformed is a festival for those on the left interested in tech and how we respond to the challenges/opportunities it brings. There’ll be sessions on how workers can organise to change Big Tech, discussions on using tech to enhance progressive campaigning, and what grassroots innovation looks like.  [Tickets available here](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/cada1/1198455).
