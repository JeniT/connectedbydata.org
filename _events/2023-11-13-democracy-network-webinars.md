The [Datasphere Initiative](https://www.thedatasphere.org/) put together [two webinars](https://cetic.br/es/seminarios-gobernanza-datos-ia-mercosur/) with a focus on the Mercosur region, one focusing on data governance and the other on AI.

Lucca Belli, from the [Getulio Vargas Foundation](https://direitorio.fgv.br/pesquisa/centro-de-tecnologia-e-sociedade), opened the conversations around data governance, arguing that Latin America does not have a “[culture of data protection](https://www.jota.info/opiniao-e-analise/artigos/o-que-falta-ao-brasil-e-a-america-latina-para-uma-protecao-de-dados-efetiva-02092021),” a concept created by Stefano Rodotà to define “the awareness through the social fabric of the profound connection between data protection and the guarantees of freedom, equality, and democracy.” Along with the fact that Brasil based its data protection laws on the GDPR without the necessary rules on enforcement (a task that is now under the many responsibilities of the country’s data protection authority), this scenario contributes to some existing massive data collection [unlawful practices](https://idec.org.br/sites/default/files/right_to_health_and_personal_data_protection.pdf).

Belli also highlighted the current efforts to create a regulatory framework across Mercosur since all countries in the region already have some type of data protection regulation.

The following conversation was around data practices in the public sector, confirming Ana Karen Tuduri’s ([Datysoc, Uruguay](https://datysoc.org/)) point that “the concept of ‘data governance’ emerged within the public sector in the region, specifically for public administration, around discussions on transparency and open data.” She believes that civil society needs to embrace this concept and involve the private sector in these conversations.

Estela Aranha (Ministry of Justice in Brasil) was the only participant to address the role of the private sector in this topic, arguing that data governance is central to a less concentrated market and less unequal development since antitrust is an ex-post solution that does not solve the lack of openness of companies regarding their data.

Another contribution that stuck with me was the concept of “interoperability of individuals” (interoperabilidad de personas) used by Natalia Carfi ([Open Data Charter, Argentina](https://opendatacharter.net/who-we-are/)). When discussing the possible solutions to the issues of lack of open data standards and interoperability in the region, she mentioned the concept to indicate the need for training individuals, capacity building and cultural change.
