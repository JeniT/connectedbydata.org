In late 2023, [Mydata Global](https://mydata.org/),[ Aapti Institute](https://aapti.in/),[ The Datasphere Initiative](https://www.thedatasphere.org/), and[ Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/) published ‘[In This Together: Combining Individual and Collective Strategies to Confront Data Power](https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/In-this-together-final.pdf), a short think piece that looks at how advocacy for better data governance can draw upon the tools of both individual data rights, and collective data governance.

In this Connected Conversation, we will interrogate what this means for concrete programming and advocacy, by asking panellists and invited participants to reflect on how their strategies to challenge the status-quo of data governance in 2024:
* Address different kinds of data, and data-related groups;
* Deploy individual and group data rights; and 
* Leverage individual and collective power.

As an invite-only Connected Conversation, written up in a short ‘Chatham House Rule’ public post , this session will provide a space for meaningful and visible coordination, enabling discussion of progress made, upcoming opportunities, and rough edges of current work to explore shared and complementary narratives, and overlapping theories of change.

This conversation will take place 13:00 - 14:00 UK time, Wednesday 20 March 2024 on Zoom. If you're interested in attending please email [Tim](mailto:tim@connectedbydata.org).
