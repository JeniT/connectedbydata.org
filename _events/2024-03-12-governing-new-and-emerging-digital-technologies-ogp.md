The Governing New & Emerging Digital Technologies global peer exchange workshop brings together government officials and civil society representatives from 12 countries leading digital governance reforms, along with a few international experts, over the course of three-and-a-half days, to address the challenges and opportunities presented by digital innovations, particularly Generative Artificial Intelligence, and their impact on democracy, human rights, and the economy.

Representatives from the following countries will be in attendance – Armenia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Philippines, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Zambia. Over the course of the workshop, participants will also be joined by representatives from Canada, United Kingdom and United States; from international organisations and bodies including Centre for Democracy and Technology, ICNL, and the UN Secretary General’s advisory board on AI; and companies including Amazon Web Services, Google and IBM.  

The workshop aims to:

* Collectively brainstorm principles for open, accountable digital governance

* Sharpen a policy roadmap for the next steps on the national digital governance reform trajectory in individual countries.
