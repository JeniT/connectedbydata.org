    - Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects
---

On Thursday 18 July 2024, on Zoom, we held the first meeting of a community of practice as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects. 

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

On 18 July we heard from:
* [Robin Carpenter](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/robin-carpenter), Ethics and Governance Lead for the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare and King’s College London, on [Collaborating well with patients when developing healthcare AI](https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/news/blog-collaborating-well-patients-when-developing-healthcare-ai)
* Elizabeth Nelson, Public Engagement, Communications and Impact Manager at Administrative Data Research Centre Northern Ireland, on ['Co-producing data-driven research with historically excluded groups'](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/involving-historically-excluded-groups-how-were-co-producing-data-driven-research-with-care-experienced-young-people/)
