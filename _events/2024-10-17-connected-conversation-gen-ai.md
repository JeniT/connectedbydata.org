Across industries, companies are seeking to exploit content generated by their workers past and present to create customised generative AI. The same pattern is appearing across journalism, education, creative industries, the legal profession, public sector, research and consultancy: wherever people write documents, the organisations that own the rights to that text – often their employers – are aiming to reuse it to build or customise AI language models.

Some workers welcome AI as a new tool that can help them in their work, but many are concerned about the use of content they have created as training data; the impacts of AI on the kind of work they do and how much they're paid; and reduced opportunities for building skills for those earlier in their careers.

We want to use this Connected Conversation to bring together people advocating for worker rights from across different sectors to learn from and build solidarity with each other. What aspects of the adoption of generative AI do workers and their representatives need to guard against? Where are unions putting in place red lines, and what are they negotiating for? How and why does this differ across sectors and contexts? What kinds of rights do workers need in law to enable them to protect their interests? And how can workers show solidarity across sectors and across the supply chain to achieve change?
