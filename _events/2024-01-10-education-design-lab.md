How can affected communities have a powerful voice in shaping the adoption of data-driven technology in schools?

<!--more-->
We brought together 17 participants for two online workshop sessions in January 2024 to explore:
* the growing use of data-driven educational technologies (EdTech) in UK schools;
* challenges around who has, and who does not, have a say in EdTech adoption;
* possible approaches to give affected communities a more powerful voice in EdTech decision making.

Participants included teachers and school counselors, teaching union representatives, and education researchers. Sessions were designed with support from [Defend Digital Me](https://defenddigitalme.org/).

The full slide deck capturing the write up of the sessions is [available here]({{site.url}}/assets/events/2024-01-EdTech-Design Lab-Summary.pdf).
