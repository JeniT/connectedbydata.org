The justice sector is affected by advances in data and AI just like any other, as it contends with a massive court backlog and cuts to legal aid. It is exploring ways in which data and AI can improve justice and access to justice through a range of digital services that rely on better access to and use of data. Along the way, the sector is contending with legacy systems, failed rollouts, missing data, and the complexity of balancing privacy and open justice in a digital age.

Working with scholars and campaigners, we are exploring how to ensure that public interest and access to justice are kept at the heart of data and digital reforms in the justice sector.
