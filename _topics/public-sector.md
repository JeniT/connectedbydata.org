The UK Government is turning to AI to help improve public services and reduce costs. These initiatives are being felt across the public sector: in [health](/topics/health), [education](/topics/education), and the [justice system](/topics/justice); in local government, central government and devolved administrations.

The public sector holds some of our most sensitive data – including about our health, income and benefits – as well as making decisions that can have huge impacts on our lives, both individually and as a society. With so much at stake, there is a democratic imperative to ensure that the public has a powerful say in how the government adopts data and AI.

We are working across the public sector with organisations and individuals who are exploring new ways of engaging the public in these decisions, as well as with the civil society organisations seeking to build transparency and accountability into the way the government adopts technology.
