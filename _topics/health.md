Health and healthcare is one of the most sensitive and personal issues for us all. With an estimated 600 million patient contacts in the NHS in 2023, the service is a vital part of our personal and community life. The NHS also holds one of the most valuable and sophisticated data sets in the world, rich with personal and population level information. Most people agree on the goal of utilising this data and introducing technology to improve healthcare, yet concerns abound abound how exactly to do that while preserving privacy, the public nature of the NHS and the human touch amid increasing automation.

We are working with patients, campaigners, workers and experts on how data and AI in healthcare uphold the value of the NHS.
