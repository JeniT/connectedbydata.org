For data and AI to work for us all, we need to rebalance away from narratives, policy and practices dominated by narrow perspectives and corporate dominated incentives.

Weâ€™re working to organise civil society as a source of countervailing power to shape a progressive landscape for technology and society. We bring together the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) and collaborate with allies on events and projects. This includes building [community power on data](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), public policy advocacy, and [key areas](https://connectedbydata.org/topics) such as work, education and justice.
