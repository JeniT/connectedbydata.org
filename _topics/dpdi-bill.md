The [Data Protection and Digital Information Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430) (DPDIB) was the Government’s legislative proposal to reform the UK’s data protection and governance regime. **It fell when the 2019-2024 parliament was dissolved before the 2024 General Election. It will not become law.**

We brought together the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/) and collaborated to hold events and create shared resources, to help support a coordinated response to the Bill.

We also supported MPs and peers responding to the Bill, through written and oral briefings, providing evidence, and drafting amendments.
